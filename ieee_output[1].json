Current methods primarily focus on recognition of limited patient\u2019s motion intentions, with the purpose of controlling preconfigured gestures of a hand exoskeleton for grasping objects. These methods exhibit a marked shortfall when encountering scenarios that are unexpected or not designed in advance, such as non-preprogrammed hand movements and object manipulation tasks. To tackle this issue, large language model (LLM) and speech recognition technology are employed in this study to allow the patient to control a hand exoskeleton at will. In particular, two LLMs are tailored to formulate codes of either generating non-preprogrammed gestures or dealing with unencountered objects. Additionally, an incremental learning framework is proposed to enable patients to perform both predefined and non-predefined operation tasks by integrating a natural language parser with the two LLM-based learners. The natural language parser can directly control the hand exoskeleton to perform predefined operations tasks from prestored command set, while the LLM-based learners can incrementally expand the control command set so as to enhance adaptability of the hand exoskeleton to complex activities over daily use. This study is a pioneering work in the field of hand exoskeletons, which will revolutionize the way to control hand exoskeletons. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily generalized to any other robots by modifying the prompt of customized LLMs, which provides a new idea to achieve autonomous learning in robotics. Note to Practitioners \u2014The motivation of this article is to tackle the challenge of intention recognition for performing activities of daily living (ADLs) by stroke patients using a multi-degree of freedom hand exoskeleton. Existing methods for intention recognition so far can only be used for several tasks that are predefined in advance, thus none of them allow patients to control the hand exoskeleton completely at will. To surpass this limitation, an LLM-enabled incremental learning framework that integrates a hand exoskeleton controller with Large Language Model (LLM) is proposed and validated in this study. The framework offers patients an intuitive interface via voice interaction and enables patients to perform not only predefined operation tasks by the hand exoskeleton controller but also non-predefined ones that can be learned from the LLM. As a result, the hand exoskeleton controller continues to learn from the LLM, therefore is gradually able to perform all tasks in daily life. This pioneering study paves a new way in building patient-controlled hand exoskeletons with autonomous intelligence that can deal with non-predefined operation tasks in unstructured environments.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TASE.2024.3382679", "Date of Publication": "02 April 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "1545-5955", "Electronic ISSN": "1558-3783"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Wenyuan Chen", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Shenyang Institute of Automation, and the Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Manufacturing, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shenyang, China"]}, {"name": "Guangyong Li", "labs": ["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Swanson School of Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"]}, {"name": "Mingwei Li", "labs": ["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology (BJUT), Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Wenxue Wang", "labs": ["Shenyang Institute of Automation, State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shenyang, China"]}, {"name": "Peng Li", "labs": ["Faculty of Information Technology, Beijing University of Technology (BJUT), Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Xiujuan Xue", "labs": ["Rehabilitation Center for the Disabled, Shenyang, China"]}, {"name": "Xingang Zhao", "labs": ["Shenyang Institute of Automation, State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shenyang, China"]}, {"name": "Lianqing Liu", "labs": ["Shenyang Institute of Automation, State Key Laboratory of Robotics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shenyang, China"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Exoskeletons", "Task analysis", "Thumb", "Robots", "Automation", "Grasping", "Control systems"], "Author Keywords": ["Hand exoskeleton", "motion intention recognition", "large language model (LLM)", "ChatGPT", "incremental learning"]}}, {"_id": "6720dcac5c42efb07ece7f0a", "Title": "AIoT Smart Home via Autonomous LLM Agents", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10729865/", "Abstract": "The common-sense reasoning abilities and vast general knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) make them a natural fit for interpreting user requests in a smart home assistant context. LLMs, however, lack specific knowledge about the user and their home, which limits their potential impact. SAGE (Smart Home Agent with Grounded Execution), overcomes these and other limitations by using a scheme in which a user request triggers an LLM-controlled sequence of discrete actions. These actions can be used to retrieve information, interact with the user, or manipulate device states. SAGE controls this process through a dynamically constructed tree of LLM prompts, which help it decide which action to take next, whether an action was successful, and when to terminate the process. The SAGE action set augments an LLM\u2019s capabilities to support some of the most critical requirements for a smart home assistant. These include: flexible and scalable user preference management (\u201cIs my team playing tonight?\u201d), access to any smart device\u2019s full functionality without device-specific code via API reading (\u201cTurn down the screen brightness on my dryer\u201d), persistent device state monitoring (\u201cRemind me to throw out the milk when I open the fridge\u201d), natural device references using only a photo of the room (\u201cTurn on the lamp on the dresser\u201d), and more.

Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant predictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fueled by prior knowledge and understanding prowess of LLMs, together with lane-aware probability learning, transcends the state-of-the-art methods across most evaluation metrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis serves to substantiate Traj-LLM's performance, as even with merely 50% of the dataset, it surpasses the majority of benchmarks relying on complete data utilization.

However, practical challenges arise in acquiring EEG signals in daily healthcare settings due to stringent data acquisition conditions, resulting in the issue of incomplete modalities. Existing studies have turned to knowledge distillation as a means to mitigate this problem by transferring knowledge from multimodal networks to unimodal ones. However, these methods are constrained by the use of a single teacher model to transfer integrated feature extraction knowledge, particularly concerning spatial and temporal features in EEG data. To address this limitation, we propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework enhanced with a Large Language Model (LLM), aimed at facilitating effective feature learning in the student network by transferring knowledge of extracting integrated features. Specifically, we employ an LLM as the teacher for extracting temporal features and a graph convolutional neural network for extracting spatial features. To further enhance knowledge distillation, we introduce causal masking and a confidence indicator into the LLM to facilitate the transfer of the most discriminative features. Extensive testing on the DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI datasets demonstrates that our model outperforms existing methods in the modality-incomplete scenario.

In China, the current CSoLC adopts the China liver cancer (CNLC) staging, which is usually evaluated by clinicians based on the patient's radiology reports. Therefore, inferring clinical information from unstructured radiology reports can provide auxiliary decision support for clinicians. The key to solving the challenging task is to guide the model to pay attention to the staging-related words or sentences, and the following issues may occur: 1) Imbalanced categories: The symptoms of liver cancer in the early- or mid-stage are not obvious, resulting in more data in the end-stage. 2) Domain sensitivity of liver cancer data: The liver cancer dataset contains a large amount of domain knowledge, and the conventional methods can exacerbate out-of-vocabulary, which greatly affects the accuracy of classification. 3) Free-text and lengthy report: The radiology report of liver cancer sparsely describes various lesions with domain-specific terms, which poses difficulties in mining key information related to staging. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a large language model (LLM)-based Knowledge-aware Attention Network (LKAN) for CSoLC. First, for maintaining semantic consistency, LLM and a rule-based algorithm are integrated to generate more diverse and reasonable data. Second, unlabeled radiology corpus of liver cancer are pre-trained to introduce domain knowledge for subsequent representation learning. Third, attention is improved by incorporating both global and local features, which can provide professional guidance for the classifier to focus on the important information.

Consequently, many organizations are investing in or acquiring insider threat detection systems to mitigate internal risks. However, three critical challenges emerge: 1) Client data frequently manifests as isolated islands, hindering information sharing without jeopardizing privacy and security. Moreover, data islands result in insufficient data for clients to train robust detection models effectively. Furthermore, it is hard for them to identify new or unknown attacks. 2) The heterogeneity, diversity, and personalized nature of clients preclude the utilization of a universal model to detect insider threats across all clients. A tailored client model adaptable to each client\u2019s specifications is imperative. 3) The daunting obstacle of expensive resource overhead, time delay and apprehensions regarding data security hinder the establishment of an effective internal threat detection system. This paper introduces FedITD, the inaugural federated Parameter-Efficient Tuning (PETuning) of Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) and Transfer Learning (TL) framework designed for insider threat detection, aimed at addressing these challenges. FedITD facilitates information integration across clients while safeguarding the privacy of each client through federated learning (FL). To evaluate the detection performance, and mitigate the resource costs, as well as concerns regarding data privacy, this study investigates three representative PETuning approaches (Adapter, BitFit, and LoRA) applied to four Pre-trained Large Language Models (BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, and DistilBERT). The findings indicate that Federated PETuning maintains acceptable performance levels while effectively reducing resource consumption and safeguarding against privacy attacks. Subsequently, it constructs custom client models via transfer learning without transmitting data to the central server. As a result, FedITD exhibits exceptional generalization ability, significantly enhancing the detection of new or unknown attacks. Extensive experimental results reveal several key insights: 1) FedITD outperforms other federated learning methods and nearly all centrally trained insider threat detection methods. Its performance is very close to the best performer using central training 2) LoRA tuning achieves optimal performance when paired with the robust pre-trained model RoBERTa. 3) FedITD significantly reduces communication costs, memory overhead, storage costs, and time delay. 4) Compared to full-tuning or PETuning the model on local data post-FL, only TF method, or only FL method, FedITD demonstrates superior performance in both local test and global test by mitigating overfitting issues and leveraging insights from other clients. 5) FedITD can be well adapted to both slightly and highly heterogeneous unlabeled target data domains and exhibits exceptional generalization ability to detect new or unknown attacks.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3482988", "Date of Publication": "17 October 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Access"}, "issn_info": {"Electronic ISSN": "2169-3536"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Zhi Qiang Wang", "labs": ["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Multimedia Communications Research Laboratory (MCRLab), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada"]}, {"name": "Haopeng Wang", "labs": ["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Multimedia Communications Research Laboratory (MCRLab), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada"]}, {"name": "Abdulmotaleb El Saddik", "labs": ["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Multimedia Communications Research Laboratory (MCRLab), University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Data models", "Adaptation models", "Threat assessment", "Tuning", "Security", "Organizations", "Costs", "Computational modeling", "Transfer learning", "Deep learning", "Computer security", "Data augmentation", "Artificial intelligence", "Machine learning"], "Author Keywords": ["Cybersecurity", "insider threat", "deep learning", "transformer", "BERT", "RoBERTa", "XLNet", "DistilBERT", "GPT", "data augmentation", "artificial intelligence", "machine learning", "Pre-trained LLM", "PETuning", "Adapter", "LoRA", "BitFit", "LLM", "NLP"]}}, {"_id": "6720dcac5c42efb07ece7f1e", "Title": "LLM for SoC Security: A Paradigm Shift", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596266/", "Abstract": "As the ubiquity and complexity of system-on-chip (SoC) designs increase across electronic devices, incorporating security into an SoC design flow poses significant challenges.

However, the intricate and irregular nature of clinical data associated with acute stroke, particularly blood pressure (BP) measurements, presents substantial obstacles to effective visual analytics and decision-making. Through a year-long collaboration with experienced neurologists, we developed PhenoFlow, a visual analytics system that leverages the collaboration between human and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze the extensive and complex data of acute ischemic stroke patients. PhenoFlow pioneers an innovative workflow, where the LLM serves as a data wrangler while neurologists explore and supervise the output using visualizations and natural language interactions. This approach enables neurologists to focus more on decision-making with reduced cognitive load. To protect sensitive patient information, PhenoFlow only utilizes metadata to make inferences and synthesize executable codes, without accessing raw patient data. This ensures that the results are both reproducible and interpretable while maintaining patient privacy. The system incorporates a slice-and-wrap design that employs temporal folding to create an overlaid circular visualization. Combined with a linear bar graph, this design aids in exploring meaningful patterns within irregularly measured BP data. Through case studies, PhenoFlow has demonstrated its capability to support iterative analysis of extensive clinical datasets, reducing cognitive load and enabling neurologists to make well-informed decisions.

Graphical perception literature has shown that human chart takeaways are sensitive to visualization design choices, such as spatial layouts. In this work, we examine the extent to which LLMs exhibit such sensitivity when generating takeaways, using bar charts with varying spatial layouts as a case study. We conducted three experiments and tested four common bar chart layouts: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked. In Experiment 1, we identified the optimal configurations to generate meaningful chart takeaways by testing four LLMs, two temperature settings, nine chart specifications, and two prompting strategies. We found that even state-of-the-art LLMs struggled to generate semantically diverse and factually accurate takeaways. In Experiment 2, we used the optimal configurations to generate 30 chart takeaways each for eight visualizations across four layouts and two datasets in both zero-shot and one-shot settings. Compared to human takeaways, we found that the takeaways LLMs generated often did not match the types of comparisons made by humans. In Experiment 3, we examined the effect of chart context and data on LLM takeaways. We found that LLMs, unlike humans, exhibited variation in takeaway comparison types for different bar charts using the same bar layout. Overall, our case study evaluates the ability of LLMs to emulate human interpretations of data and points to challenges and opportunities in using LLMs to predict human chart takeaways.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TVCG.2024.3456378", "Date of Publication": "16 September 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "1077-2626", "Electronic ISSN": "1941-0506"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Huichen Will Wang", "labs": ["University of Washington, USA"]}, {"name": "Jane Hoffswell", "labs": ["Adobe Research, USA"]}, {"name": "Sao Myat Thazin Thane", "labs": ["UMass Amherst, USA"]}, {"name": "Victor S.

However, the distinct electrochemical characteristics coupled with harsh low-temperature environments make a single estimator struggle to robustly estimate the volatile SOC of multi-type LIBs. To address these issues, this article proposes a hard-soft hybrid prompt learning method to unleash the potential of a pretrained large language model (LLM) for SOC estimation. A textual encoder is introduced to convert LIB measurements into hard text prompts for language modeling, naturally eliciting the pretrained LLM to capture the intra-relations of measured values over time and their inter-relations with contextual semantics for accurate estimates. A side adapter network is constructed to reparameterize model adaptation towards different LIB tasks into optimizations within a low-dimensional subspace, strengthening the estimation generalization of the pretrained LLM in a parameter-efficient manner. A knowledge infusion mechanism is designed to encapsulate task-specific information as soft prompt vectors for model integration along forward propagation, dynamically conditioning the hidden states inside the pretrained LLM to enhance the estimation robustness against SOC volatilities.

To address these issues, LLMs call for the integration of federated learning (FL), which enables the collaborative learning of a powerful LLM using private data and computing resources from multiple entities. In this article, we present a systematic introduction to the federated large language model (Fed-LLM), a distributed learning of LLM in the FL manner. We first introduce the learning paradigm of Fed-LLM, which is called federated parameter-efficient fine-tuning (Fed-PEFT). Fed-PEFT empowers the collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs by only involving a small subset of parameters in local LLMs. Specifically, we detail the workflow of Fed-PEFT, and summarize the state-of-the-art solutions in this area.

The current approaches for collaboration with multiple LLM agents are static approaches, which adopt a fixed set of agents to interact with each other.

This framework enables decentralized autonomous collaboration between LLM agents, allowing them to register themselves, discover the capabilities of other agents, and assign tasks on the platform. LLMs can convert natural language descriptions from human and LLM agent users into smart contract calls, enabling agents to interact with humans, the blockchain, and other agents to achieve automation.

In terms of LLM4Search, we examine how LLMs can be used to summarize content for better indexing by search engines, improve query outcomes through optimization, enhance the ranking of search results by analyzing document relevance, and help in annotating data for learning-to-rank tasks in various learning contexts. However, this promising integration comes with its challenges, which include addressing potential biases and ethical issues in training models, managing the computational and other costs of incorporating LLMs into search services, and continuously updating LLM training with the ever-changing web content. We discuss these challenges and chart out required research directions to address them. We also discuss broader implications for service computing, such as scalability, privacy concerns, and the need to adapt search engine architectures for these advanced models.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TSC.2024.3451185", "Date of Publication": "28 August 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Services Computing"}, "issn_info": {"Electronic ISSN": "1939-1374"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Haoyi Xiong", "labs": ["Baidu, Inc., Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Jiang Bian", "labs": ["Baidu, Inc., Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Yuchen Li", "labs": ["Baidu, Inc., Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Xuhong Li", "labs": ["Baidu, Inc., Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Mengnan Du", "labs": ["New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ"]}, {"name": "Shuaiqiang Wang", "labs": ["Baidu, Inc., Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Dawei Yin", "labs": ["Baidu, Inc., Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Sumi Helal", "labs": ["University of Bologna, Italy"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Search engines", "Accuracy", "Training", "Service computing", "Indexing", "Chatbots", "Transformers"], "Author Keywords": ["Large Language Models (LLMs)", "Search Engines", "Learning-to-Rank (LTR)", "and Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG)"]}}, {"_id": "6720dcac5c42efb07ece7f37", "Title": "Large Language Models for Networking: Applications, Enabling Techniques, and Challenges", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614634/", "Abstract": "The rapid evolution of network technologies and the growing complexity of network tasks necessitate a paradigm shift in how networks are designed, configured, and managed.

Nevertheless, the increasing size of LLMs comes with a significant surge in the computational requirements for training and deployment. Memristor crossbars have emerged as a promising solution, which demonstrated a small footprint and remarkably high energy efficiency in computer vision (CV) models. Memristors possess higher density compared to conventional memory technologies, making them highly suitable for effectively managing the extreme model size associated with LLMs. However, deploying LLMs on memristor crossbars faces three major challenges. Firstly, the size of LLMs increases rapidly, already surpassing the capabilities of state-of-the-art memristor chips. Secondly, LLMs often incorporate multi-head attention blocks, which involve non-weight stationary multiplications that traditional memristor crossbars cannot support. Third, while memristor crossbars excel at performing linear operations, they are not capable of executing complex nonlinear operations in LLM such as softmax and layer normalization.

Intrusion detection systems (IDS) based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are introduced to mitigate security threats. However, existing ML/DL-based IDS suffer from challenges in IoV environments. First, due to the limitations of ML/DLbased methods, classification performance is unsatisfactory when they extract only unidirectional contextual features or spatial characteristics. Second, existing research on in-vehicle network IDS often limits validation and testing to a static dataset of a single vehicle model. This approach may not adequately address diverse potential attacks in a dynamic environment. Third, few studies of hybrid IDS can simultaneously implement in-vehicle and extra-vehicle network intrusion detection. Large language models (LLM) have shown outstanding applications in fields such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). In particular, bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) obtain new state-of-the-art results on eleven famous NLP tasks. Consequently, this paper introduces a hybrid network IDS in IoV utilising LLM, denoted as IoV-BERT-IDS. This framework encompasses four modules: semantic extractor (SE), input embedding, IoV-BERT-IDS pre-training, and IoVBERT- IDS fine-tuning. To conform to the BERT model, the semantic extractor is introduced to transform traffic data devoid of apparent semantics into contextual semantics, comprising bidirectional and unidirectional SE. Through SE, controller area network (CAN) data is transformed into a CAN byte sentence (CBS), while extra-vehicle network traffic data is transformed into a traffic byte sentence (TBS). Additionally, two pre-training tasks, the masked byte word model (MBWM) and next byte sentence prediction (NBSP) are proposed to acquire bidirectional contextual features from contextual semantics. These features can be adapted to downstream tasks in both in-vehicle and extravehicle networks through fine-tuning.

Automated detection of fake news remains a salient topic of discourse within scholarly communities. With the swift progression of artificial intelligence, we have transitioned into the epoch of large language models. This review delineates the challenges and prospective directions associated with fake news detection in the context of these large language models. The present article aims to give scholars a comprehensive overview of fake news detection during this era of large language models, thereby aiding in streamlining subsequent inquiries and studies in the domain.\nResearch into fake news detection has a long history, although it gained significant attention following the 2016 US election. During this time, the widespread use of social media and the resulting increase in interpersonal communication led to the extensive spread of ambiguous and potentially misleading news. Traditional approaches, relying solely on pre- LLM (large language model) techniques and addressing the issue as a simple classification problem, have shown to be insufficient for improving detection accuracy. In this context, large language models have become crucial, as their advanced architectures overcome the limitations of pre-LLM methods, which often fail to capture the subtleties of fake news. This literature review aims to shed light on the field of fake news detection by providing a brief historical overview, defining fake news, reviewing detection methods used before the advent of large language models, and discussing the strengths and weaknesses of these models in an increasingly complex landscape.

Our study evaluates LLM performance in detecting defects, such as ambiguities, inconsistencies, and incompleteness, while also analyzing GPT-4\u2019s ability to identify issues across version iterations and support technical experts in requirements analysis. Qualitatively, we identify key limitations of LLMs in defect detection, notably their inability to cross-reference throughout the document and their constrained understanding of specialized contexts. Quantitatively, we find that while LLMs excel in identifying incomplete requirements (precision 0.61), their performance is less impressive in detecting inconsistencies (precision 0.43) and ambiguities (precision 0.39). Although GPT-4 demonstrates promise in automating early defect detection across versions and providing accurate technical answers, our results underscore that they cannot entirely replace human analysts due to their lack of nuanced domain knowledge in a zero-shot setting.

In 6G-IATS, large-scale traffic flow prediction, affiliated with time series prediction, holds significant value for transportation planning and urban management. As an emerging AI method, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged prominently in time series forecasting. Unfortunately, it is challenging to achieve accurate and efficient large-scale traffic flow prediction by LLMs in 6G-IATS, due to the two issues: a) these LLMs fail to capture the spatio-temporal correlations in a large-scale road network, leading to limited prediction accuracy, and b) they process a substantial amount of training data on the central server, which imposes low training efficiency. Jointly considering the two concerns, this paper proposes a novel LLM and edge computing-based architecture for large-scale traffic flow prediction in 6G-IATS, called Spatio-Temporal Generative Large Language Model on Edge (STGLLM-E). In this architecture, we first decompose the entire large-scale road network into several subgraphs. To capture the spatio-temporal correlations, an LLM-based method named Spatio-Temporal Generative Large Language Model (STGLLM) including Spatio-Temporal Module (STM) and Generative Large Language Model (GLLM) is proposed. Secondly, to improve the training efficiency of the STGLLM-E, an edge training strategy based on edge servers is devised. Experiments are conducted on two real-world traffic flow datasets.

In today\u2019s digital landscape, where the internet and social media facilitate the rapid dissemination of information, discerning between accurate content and falsified information presents a formidable challenge. Misinformation, often arising unintentionally, and disinformation, crafted deliberately, are at the forefront of this challenge. LLMs such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4, equipped with advanced language generation abilities, present a double-edged sword in this scenario. While they hold promise in combating misinformation by fact-checking and detecting LLM-generated text, their ability to generate realistic, contextually relevant text also poses risks for creating and propagating misinformation. Further, LLMs are plagued with many problems such as biases, knowledge cutoffs, and hallucinations, which may further perpetuate misinformation and disinformation. The paper outlines historical developments in misinformation detection and how it affects social media consumption, especially among youth, and introduces LLMs and their applications in various domains. It then critically analyzes the potential of LLMs to generate and counter misinformation and disinformation in sensitive topics such as healthcare, COVID-19, and political agendas. Further, it discusses mitigation strategies, ethical considerations, and regulatory measures, summarizing previous methods and proposing future research direction toward leveraging the benefits of LLMs while minimizing misuse risks.

Previous works approach this problem from topic- and entity-based perspectives, but the capability of the underlying NLP model limits their effectiveness. Recent advances in prompting with LLMs present opportunities to enhance such approaches with higher accuracy and customizability. However, poorly designed prompts and visualizations could mislead users into falsely interpreting the visualizations and hinder the system's trustworthiness. In this paper, we address this issue by taking into account the user analysis tasks and visualization goals in the prompt-based data extraction stage, thereby extending the concept of Model Alignment. We present HINTs, a VA system for supporting sensemaking on large collections of documents, combining previous entity-based and topic-based approaches. The visualization pipeline of HINTs consists of three stages. First, entities and topics are extracted from the corpus with prompts. Then, the result is modeled as a hypergraph and hierarchically clustered. Finally, an enhanced space-filling curve layout is applied to visualize the hypergraph for interactive exploration. The system further integrates an LLM-based intelligent chatbot agent in the interface to facilitate the sensemaking of interested documents. To demonstrate the generalizability and effectiveness of the HINTs system, we present two case studies on different domains and a comparative user study. We report our insights on the behavior patterns and challenges when intelligent agents are used to facilitate sensemaking. We find that while intelligent agents can address many challenges in sensemaking, the visual hints that visualizations provide are still necessary.

The data generated by these devices is utilized for analysis and services, especially in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applied to IoT, known as Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). The enhancement of edge device computing power in the IoT has led to the emergence of research areas like edge-cloud synergy AI theories and application services. In the context of lifelong learning and real-time processes in AIoT edge-cloud synergy services, addressing unseen tasks becomes crucial. Unseen tasks arise when inference requests from edge devices involve models not present in the cloud\u2019s model repository. Addressing these challenges involves generating data to either augment small sample problems or alter the data distribution for heterogeneous sample issues. As the application of large language models (LLMs) for data generation gains traction, challenges emerge in the context of AIoT edge-cloud synergy services. Firstly, fine-tuning LLMs with heterogeneous data exacerbates model bias issues. Secondly, the substantial data requirements for training LLMs pose a contradiction. Lastly, the involvement of manual annotation in LLM-based data generation introduces complexity and cost. This paper proposes a framework Seafarer to these challenges using Generative Adversarial Networks and Self-taught Learning. Seafarer avoids model bias, reduces data requirements, and eliminates the need for manual annotation.

While machine learning models have been used to predict flakiness and its root causes, there is much less work on providing support to fix the problem. To address this gap, in this paper, we focus on predicting the type of fix that is required to remove flakiness and then repair the test code on that basis. We do this for a subset of flaky tests where the root cause of flakiness is in the test itself and not in the production code. One key idea is to guide the repair process with additional knowledge about the test\u2019s flakiness in the form of its predicted fix category. Thus, we first propose a framework that automatically generates labeled datasets for 13 fix categories and trains models to predict the fix category of a flaky test by analyzing the test code only. Our experimental results using code models and few-shot learning show that we can correctly predict most of the fix categories. To show the usefulness of such fix category labels for automatically repairing flakiness, we augment the prompts of GPT 3.5 Turbo, a Large Language Model (LLM), with such extra knowledge to request repair suggestions. The results show that our suggested fix category labels, complemented with in-context learning, significantly enhance the capability of GPT 3.5 Turbo in generating fixes for flaky tests. Based on the execution and analysis of a sample of GPT-repaired flaky tests, we estimate that a large percentage of such repairs, (roughly between 51% and 83%) can be expected to pass. For the failing repaired tests, on average, 16% of the test code needs to be further changed for them to pass.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TSE.2024.3472476", "Date of Publication": "02 October 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "0098-5589", "Electronic ISSN": "1939-3520"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Sakina Fatima", "labs": ["School of EECS, University of Ottawa, Canada"]}, {"name": "Hadi Hemmati", "labs": ["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, York University, Canada"]}, {"name": "Lionel Briand", "labs": ["School of EECS, University of Ottawa, Canada"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Codes", "Predictive models", "Maintenance engineering", "Analytical models", "Production", "Large language models", "Java", "Few shot learning", "Python", "Manuals"], "Author Keywords": ["Flaky Tests", "Fix Category", "Test Repair", "Large Language Models", "Code Models", "Few Shot Learning", "Software Testing"]}}, {"_id": "6720dcac5c42efb07ece7f4a", "Title": "LaMoSC: Large Language Model-Driven Semantic Communication System for Visual Transmission", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531769/", "Abstract": "The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize network communication.

This restriction not only sacrifices semantic reasoning capabilities accessed through natural language but also limits the ability to handle temporal irregularities. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Language-Scaffolded Time Series Transformer (LSTST), which combines linguistic components and time series embeddings to effectively harness LLMs while overcoming dimensional constraints. Our Language Scaffold reformulates time series classification as a contextual question-answering task, with time series embeddings as context, facilitating the LLM to utilize its inherent semantic knowledge. Moreover, the preserved linguistic structure allows a dynamic number of input context embeddings with real-time positional encoding, handling length restrictions and irregularity in the temporal dimension.

An emerging solution is to employ Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to enhance IoV security, which depends on the quality, quantity, and freshness of the threat data used for fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce a collaborative vehicular threat sharing framework that utilizes vehicular honeypots to gather threat data for fine-tuning LLMs, thereby bolstering IoV security. Local differential privacy is leveraged to safeguard the vehicles\u2019 privacy. Given that vehicles have different privacy preferences that may change over time, it is critical to design an appropriate incentive mechanism to encourage sustainable participation in the dynamic IoV environment. Moreover, since privacy preferences are the private information of the vehicles, an information asymmetry exists between the vehicles and the IDS cloud server. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic contract-based incentive mechanism that considers the dynamically changing privacy preference during long-term participation. The optimal contract is derived to maximize the expected utility of the IDS cloud server. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed dynamic contract based incentive mechanism and validate the effectiveness of the LLM-based threat classification in handling complex threats.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TITS.2024.3461855", "Date of Publication": "26 September 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "1524-9050", "Electronic ISSN": "1558-0016"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Chao He", "labs": ["School of Cyber Engineering, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"]}, {"name": "Yuntao Wang", "labs": ["School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"]}, {"name": "Juan Hu", "labs": ["National Key Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"]}, {"name": "Tom H.

To address this concern, our research examines different prompt types for shaping responses from code generation tasks to produce safer outputs.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer a potential solution to transform EBM by automating labor-intensive tasks and thereby improving the efficiency of clinical decision-making. This study explores integrating LLMs into the key stages in EBM, evaluating their ability across evidence retrieval (PICO extraction, biomedical question answering), synthesis (summarizing randomized controlled trials), and dissemination (medical text simplification). We conducted a comparative analysis of seven LLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, as well as those fine-tuned on medical corpora. Specifically, we benchmarked the performance of various LLMs on each EBM task under zero-shot settings as baselines, and employed prompting techniques, including in-context learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and knowledge-guided prompting to enhance their capabilities. Our extensive experiments revealed the strengths of LLMs, such as remarkable understanding capabilities even in zero-shot settings, strong summarization skills, and effective knowledge transfer via prompting. Promoting strategies such as knowledge-guided prompting proved highly effective (e.g., improving the performance of GPT-4 by 13.10% over zero-shot in PICO extraction). However, the experiments also showed limitations, with LLM performance falling well below state-of-the-art baselines like PubMedBERT in handling named entity recognition tasks.

While recent machine learning solutions offer some advancements, they typically struggle with maintaining high accuracy across any given RTL design. In this work, we propose an innovative transferable pre-synthesis PPA estimation framework named MasterRTL. It first converts the HDL code to a new bit-level design representation named the simple operator graph (SOG). By only adopting single-bit simple operators, this SOG proves to be a general representation that unifies different design types and styles. The SOG is also more similar to the target gate-level netlist, reducing the gap between RTL representation and netlist. In addition to the new SOG representation, Master-RTL proposes new ML methods for the RTL-stage modeling of timing, power, and area separately. Compared with state-of-theart solutions, the experiment on a comprehensive dataset with 90 different designs shows accuracy improvement by 0.33, 0.22, and 0.15 in correlation for total negative slack (TNS), worst negative slack (WNS), and power, respectively. Besides the prediction of synthesis results, MasterRTL also excels in accurately predicting layout-stage PPA based on RTL designs and in adapting across different technology nodes and process corners. Furthermore, we investigate two effective data augmentation techniques: a graph generation method and a Large Language Model (LLM)-based approach.

Since the original foundation models contain a very large number of parameters, fine-tuning them can be quite challenging. Development of the low-rank adaption technique (LoRA) for fine-tuning, and the quantized version of LoRA, also known as QLoRA, allows for fine-tuning of LLMs on a new smaller corpus of data. This paper focuses on the repeatability of fine-tuning four LLMs using QLoRA. We have fine-tuned them for seven trials each under the same hardware and software settings. We also validated our study for the repeatability (stability) issue by fine-tuning LLMs on two public datasets. For each trial, each LLM was fine-tuned on a subset of the dataset and tested on a holdout test set. Fine-tuning and inference were done on a single GPU.

Such networks project the image feature once and do not consider the interaction between the image and the human inputs. Hence, the obtained visual information without being connected to human intention may be inadequate for LLMs to generate intention-following responses, which we refer to as static visual information. To alleviate this issue, our paper introduces LMEye, a human-like eye with a play-and plug interactive perception network, designed to enable dynamic interaction between LLMs and external visual information. It can allow the LLM to request the desired visual information aligned with various human instructions, which we term dynamic visual information acquisition. Specifically, LMEye consists of a simple visual mapping network to provide the basic perception of an image for LLMs. It also contains additional modules responsible for acquiring requests from LLMs, performing request-based visual information seeking, and transmitting the resulting interacted visual information to LLMs, respectively. In this way, LLMs act to understand the human query, deliver the corresponding request to the request-based visual information interaction module, and generate the response based on the interleaved multimodal information. We evaluate LMEye through extensive experiments on multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating that it significantly improves zero-shot performances on various multimodal tasks compared to previous methods, with fewer parameters.

Very recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied in diverse code-related tasks owing to their powerful generality. Yet, in the CMG field, few studies systematically explored their effectiveness. This paper conducts the first comprehensive experiment to investigate how far we have been in applying LLM to generate high-quality commit messages and how to go further beyond in this field. Motivated by a pilot analysis, we first construct a multi-lingual high-quality CMG test set following practitioners\u2019 criteria. Afterward, we re-evaluate diverse CMG approaches and make comparisons with recent LLMs. To delve deeper into LLMs\u2019 ability, we further propose four manual metrics following the practice of OSS, including Accuracy, Integrity, Readability, and Applicability for assessment. Results reveal that LLMs have outperformed existing CMG approaches overall, and different LLMs carry different advantages, where GPT-3.5 performs best.\nTo further boost LLMs\u2019 performance in the CMG task, we propose an Efficient Retrieval-based In-Context Learning (ICL) framework, namely ERICommiter, which leverages a two-step filtering to accelerate the retrieval efficiency and introduces semantic/lexical-based retrieval algorithm to construct the ICL examples, thereby guiding the generation of high-quality commit messages with LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the substantial performance improvement of ERICommiter on various LLMs across different programming languages.

Recent efforts primarily focus on scaling up training datasets (i.e., charts, data tables, and question-answer (QA) pairs) through data collection and synthesis. However, our empirical study on existing MLLMs and CQA datasets reveals notable gaps. First, current data collection and synthesis focus on data volume and lack consideration of fine-grained visual encodings and QA tasks, resulting in unbalanced data distribution divergent from practical CQA scenarios. Second, existing work follows the training recipe of the base MLLMs initially designed for natural images, under-exploring the adaptation to unique chart characteristics, such as rich text elements. To fill the gap, we propose a visualization-referenced instruction tuning approach to guide the training dataset enhancement and model development. Specifically, we propose a novel data engine to effectively filter diverse and high-quality data from existing datasets and subsequently refine and augment the data using LLM-based generation techniques to better align with practical QA tasks and visual encodings. Then, to facilitate the adaptation to chart characteristics, we utilize the enriched data to train an MLLM by unfreezing the vision encoder and incorporating a mixture-of-resolution adaptation strategy for enhanced fine-grained recognition. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Even with fewer training examples, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CQA models on established benchmarks.

In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60 s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains.

In response, we introduce a feature-oriented workflow for systematic prompt evaluation. In the context of text summarization, our workflow advocates evaluation with summary characteristics (feature metrics) such as complexity, formality, or naturalness, instead of using traditional quality metrics like ROUGE.

Though existing notable efforts have resulted in impressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and understanding of complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM, the first to investigate the potential of using pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit prompt engineering to generate future motions from vehicular past trajectories and traffic scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint encoding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that LLMs understand. On this basis, we creatively explore LLMs' strong understanding capability to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and interactive information. To emulate the human-like lane focus cognitive function and enhance Traj-LLM's scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant predictions.

This study presents a pioneering approach to establish a multimodal LLM tailored for PE design applications, named PE-GPT. The methodology involves enhancing PE-GPT with retrieval augmented generation from a PE knowledge base, and proposes a hybrid framework that integrates an LLM agent with metaheuristic algorithms, Model Zoo, and Simulation Repository. This enhances its multimodal processing capabilities and enables integration into the existing design workflow. The PE-GPT methodology is demonstrated with two case studies: modulation design of the dual-active bridge (DAB) converter and circuit parameter design of the buck converter. PE-GPT demonstrates a 22.2% increase in correctness compared to human experts. Against other leading LLMs, PE-GPT shows a 35.6% improvement in correctness and a 15.4% enhancement in consistency, reducing hallucination. Hardware experiments validate PE-GPT\u2019s multimodal capabilities in optimizing a five-degree-of-freedom modulation strategy for the DAB converter.

However, practical challenges arise in acquiring EEG signals in daily healthcare settings due to stringent data acquisition conditions, resulting in the issue of incomplete modalities. Existing studies have turned to knowledge distillation as a means to mitigate this problem by transferring knowledge from multimodal networks to unimodal ones. However, these methods are constrained by the use of a single teacher model to transfer integrated feature extraction knowledge, particularly concerning spatial and temporal features in EEG data. To address this limitation, we propose a multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework enhanced with a Large Language Model (LLM), aimed at facilitating effective feature learning in the student network by transferring knowledge of extracting integrated features. Specifically, we employ an LLM as the teacher for extracting temporal features and a graph convolutional neural network for extracting spatial features. To further enhance knowledge distillation, we introduce causal masking and a confidence indicator into the LLM to facilitate the transfer of the most discriminative features. Extensive testing on the DEAP and MAHNOB-HCI datasets demonstrates that our model outperforms existing methods in the modality-incomplete scenario.

Recent advancements in large AI models, particularly in the multimodal language model (MLM) and large language model (LLM), offer potential solutions for addressing these issues. To this end, we propose a large AI model-based multimodal SC (LAM-MSC) framework, where we first present the MLMbased multimodal alignment (MMA) that utilizes the MLM to enable the transformation between multimodal and unimodal data while preserving semantic consistency.

Recent efforts primarily focus on scaling up training datasets (i.e., charts, data tables, and question-answer (QA) pairs) through data collection and synthesis. However, our empirical study on existing MLLMs and CQA datasets reveals notable gaps. First, current data collection and synthesis focus on data volume and lack consideration of fine-grained visual encodings and QA tasks, resulting in unbalanced data distribution divergent from practical CQA scenarios. Second, existing work follows the training recipe of the base MLLMs initially designed for natural images, under-exploring the adaptation to unique chart characteristics, such as rich text elements. To fill the gap, we propose a visualization-referenced instruction tuning approach to guide the training dataset enhancement and model development. Specifically, we propose a novel data engine to effectively filter diverse and high-quality data from existing datasets and subsequently refine and augment the data using LLM-based generation techniques to better align with practical QA tasks and visual encodings. Then, to facilitate the adaptation to chart characteristics, we utilize the enriched data to train an MLLM by unfreezing the vision encoder and incorporating a mixture-of-resolution adaptation strategy for enhanced fine-grained recognition. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Even with fewer training examples, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CQA models on established benchmarks.

In our work, we address this question by evaluating the GPT-4 multimodal LLM using a suite of task sets meant to assess the model's visualization literacy.

It can allow the LLM to request the desired visual information aligned with various human instructions, which we term dynamic visual information acquisition. Specifically, LMEye consists of a simple visual mapping network to provide the basic perception of an image for LLMs. It also contains additional modules responsible for acquiring requests from LLMs, performing request-based visual information seeking, and transmitting the resulting interacted visual information to LLMs, respectively. In this way, LLMs act to understand the human query, deliver the corresponding request to the request-based visual information interaction module, and generate the response based on the interleaved multimodal information.

Such massive heterogeneous devices pose huge challenges for network control and management. Recently, advances in artificial intelligence have brought to a new clan of networks, termed as self-driving 6G networks. It utilizes network telemetry, artificial intelligence, and DevOps to simplify networks and operations, helping network owners improve network quality, as well as increase efficiency. However, the current network is built on closed merchant switching ASICs and a homegrown management and control system. Self-driving an opaque system without really knowing and controlling what they do is a hazardous and fruitless endeavor. Fortunately, the network programmability technology opens the possibility for running self-driving algorithms over the whole network. In this paper, we design a full-dimensional programmability empowered self-driving 6G network architecture. We discuss how network programmability can promote the release of network intelligence, from the view of both verticality (control and data plane) and horizontality (end to end). Moreover, three use cases are designed to demonstrate that the proposed architecture can automatically cope with the dynamically changing complex network environment, realize automatic perception and automatic decision, and then facilitate the automation level of the network and enhance the performance of the network.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/MNET.2024.3448288", "Date of Publication": "22 August 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Network"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "0890-8044", "Electronic ISSN": "1558-156X"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Tong Wu", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Haipeng Yao", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Tianle Mai", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Zunliang Wang", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Fu Wang", "labs": ["School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Mohsen Guizani", "labs": ["Machine Learning Department, Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), UAE"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["6G mobile communication", "Switches", "Computer architecture", "Control systems", "Artificial intelligence", "Telemetry", "Network architecture"], "Author Keywords": ["6G", "Programmable Network", "Self-driving Network", "Network Control"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f4414cae7071f474269", "Title": "Monza: An Energy-Minimal, General-Purpose Dataflow SoC for the Internet of Things", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10608171/", "Abstract": "This paper describes the design and implementation of Monza , a testchip SoC featuring Efficient Computer Company\u2019s Fabric processor.

Edge computing and blockchain technologies facilitate the IIoT in terms of low latency services and data security respectively.

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-blockchain adopts a graph structure of a single transaction as the basic unit, and it has the characteristics of asynchronous consensus. Some existing studies use DAGblockchain to replace the traditional blockchain to alleviate its low throughput problems like IOTA. However, with the rapid data generation in the IIoT environment, the topology scale of DAG-blockchain will increase sharply, which will aggravate the data storage cost of blockchain nodes. In this article, to reduce the data storage cost of edge servers, we design a Graphpartition based storage strategy for DAG-Blockchain (GpDB), equipped with a graph partition algorithm based on transaction freshness, which can partition DAG-blockchain topology in edge servers into two parts, which will be retained and removed respectively.

Blockchain consensus mechanisms (CMs) are key to enabling nodes in a wireless network to achieve consistency without any trusted entity. However, consensus reliability will be seriously affected by the instability of communication links in wireless networks. Meanwhile, it is difficult for nodes in wireless scenarios to obtain a timely energy supply. Energy-intensive blockchain functions can quickly drain the power of nodes, thus degrading consensus performance. Fortunately, a symbiotic radio (SR) system enabled by cognitive backscatter communications can solve the above problems. In SR, the secondary transmitter (STx) transmits messages over the radio frequency (RF) signal emitted from a primary transmitter (PTx) with extremely low energy consumption, and the STx can provide multipath gain to the PTx in return. Such an approach is useful for almost all vote-based CMs, such as the Practical Byzantine Fault-tolerant (PBFT)-like and the RAFT-like CMs. This paper proposes symbiotic blockchain consensus (SBC) by transforming 6 PBFT-like and 4 RAFT-like state-of-the-art (SOTA) CMs to demonstrate universality. These new CMs will benefit from mutualistic transmission relationships in SR, making full use of the limited spectrum resources in WBN.

Many recent works solve this problem based on the set-enumeration (SE) tree, which sequentially traverses vertices to generate the enumeration tree nodes representing distinct bicliques, then checks whether these bicliques are maximal or not. However, existing MBE algorithms only expand bicliques with untraversed vertices to ensure distinction, which often necessitate extensive node checks to eliminate non-maximal bicliques, resulting in significant computational overhead during the enumeration process. To address this issue, we propose an aggressive set-enumeration (ASE) tree that aggressively expands all bicliques to their maximal form, thus avoiding costly node checks on non-maximal bicliques. This aggressive enumeration may produce multiple duplicate maximal bicliques, but we efficiently eliminate these duplicates by lever-aging the connection between parent and child nodes and conducting low-cost node checking. Additionally, we introduce an aggressive merge-based pruning (AMP) approach that aggressively merges vertices sharing the same local neighbors. This helps prune numerous duplicate node generations caused by subsets of merged vertices. We integrate the AMP approach into the ASE tree, and present the Aggressive Maximal Biclique Enumeration Algorithm (AMBEA). Experimental results show that AMBEA is 1.15\u00d7 to 5.32\u00d7 faster than its closest competitor and exhibits better scalability and parallelization capabilities on larger bipartite graphs.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TC.2024.3441864", "Date of Publication": "12 August 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Computers"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "0018-9340", "Electronic ISSN": "1557-9956"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Zhe Pan", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, and the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}, {"name": "Xu Li", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, and the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}, {"name": "Shuibing He", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, and the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}, {"name": "Xuechen Zhang", "labs": ["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University Vancouver, Vancouver, WA, USA"]}, {"name": "Rui Wang", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, and the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}, {"name": "Yunjun Gao", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, and the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}, {"name": "Gang Chen", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, and the College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}, {"name": "Xian-He Sun", "labs": ["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, Illinois, USA"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Bipartite graph", "Computers", "Scalability", "Electronic commerce", "Computer science", "Sun", "Data security"], "Author Keywords": ["Graph computing", "bipartite graph", "maximal biclique enumeration"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f47495d", "Title": "EPFFL: Enhancing Privacy and Fairness in Federated Learning for Distributed e-Healthcare Data Sharing Services", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10606054/", "Abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has made remarkable achievements in medical and e-healthcare services.

Therefore, ensuring privacy and fairness in collaborative training remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-enhanced and Fair FL scheme (EPFFL) to support distributed large-scale data sharing of e-healthcare services. In the training process, participants upload the encrypted model gradients according to their sharing wishes to the blockchain while storing their training data locally. Hence, the FL initiator can only get the aggregated gradients from the blockchain rather than the local data of other participants. Moreover, EPFFL ensures fairness by evaluating the participants' contributions, i.e., participants with different data qualities and sharing levels can obtain the final models with different accuracies at the end of the training.

Blockchain interoperability addresses isolatability between heterogeneous blockchains, while sharding-based blockchain achieves scalability by solving isolatability of homogeneous blockchains running in different shards. To ensure atomicity between different blockchains, they both need to overcome two significant problems: (1) how to handle cross-chain transactions without trusting any third parties; (2) how to enhance the resistance to double-spending attacks of participating blockchains. To this end, this work presents a two-tier multi-zone architecture, Distributed and Parallel Blockchain ( DP-Chain ), where Consensus Zone in tier-1 features blockchain interoperability and sharding-based blockchain by allowing homogeneous or heterogeneous blockchains run in different zones, while Coordination Layer in tier-2 allows them to interoperate as a Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) without trusting any third parties. Meanwhile, the coordination scheme between the two tiers is designed to resist potential double-spending attacks. Then, stochastic models are used to capture DP-Chain consensus process and analyze the probability of successful double-spending attacks. These analyses can help understand DP-Chain easily and offer theoretical guidelines for further implementations.

To avoid this situation, we present an augmented adaptive Trust Management Credibility Score Scheme (TMCSS) scheme that registers the vehicles before starting any services at blockchain miners. These registration certificates are changeable once DCNN detects any malicious activity in the vehicle data.

It is very important to fuse the data obtained from heterogeneous Blockchain nodes in such a way that it can provide some useful information after processing. The analysis of the data must be made without losing the useful chunks of the information especially when it involves financial transactions. By combining the data from multiple sources in a Blockchain environment, the accuracy and completeness of data can be assured. The reliability of data is also enhanced since the data can be validated easily with the cross-reference points. The integration of data allows comprehensive analysis of data and also helps in decision making. It also helps in detection of frauds by reducing the dimensionality of data. In order to improve the interaction in the data, and to enhance the data transmission rate, a new soft computing based data fusion control model has been proposed in this article for the fusion of data in Blockchain databases that supports communications over 6G channels. The proposed model comprises hardware and software components along with soft computing based smart data fusion mechanism. The proposed soft computing-based mechanism behaves smartly to process the volume of data by training the system implicitly. The fuzzy logic-based similarity matrix is also devised by calculating the similarity in the data instances to make the system more adaptive. The fusion of a Big-data in the Blockchain systems is performed on the basis of the proposed model for controlling the data interactions. The empirical results show that the proposed data fusion control model for Big-data in the Blockchain system is reliable, secure, and has lower response time.

Many approaches to improving blockchain scalability often result in diminished security or compromise the decentralized nature of the system. Inspired by network science, especially the epidemic model, we try to solve this problem by mapping the propagation of transactions and blocks as two interacting epidemics, called the CoSIS model. We extend the transaction propagation process to increase the efficiency of block propagation, which reduces the number of unknown transactions. The reduction of the block propagation latency ultimately increases the blockchain throughput. The theory of complex networks is employed to offer an optimal boundary condition. Finally, the node scores are stored in the chain, so that it also provides a new incentive approach. Our experiments show that CoSIS accelerates blocks!/ propagation and TPS is raised by 20% ~ 33% on average. At the same time, the system security can be significantly improved, as an orphaned block rate is close to zero in better cases.

Redactable blockchain represents a potential solution for enabling the controlled modification of data on blocks. However, current redactable blockchain schemes suffer from high computational overhead and lack support for stateful redaction and consistency checking. In this paper, we propose a secure and efficient decentralized chameleon hash scheme (CHSTS) based on Schnorr threshold signatures. CHSTS allows t-out-of-n edge nodes to collaborate with the transaction proposer to compute chameleon hash collisions, enabling modification and deletion of block data without breaking the hash links between the blocks. We then construct a redactable blockchain utilizing CHSTS to alleviate the storage limitations of edge nodes. To ensure consistency checking and stateful redaction of the redactable blockchain, we design a novel modification verification mechanism based on vector commitments. Finally, we provide detailed security analysis of the CHSTS scheme and integrate the proposed scheme into Hyperledger Fabric to evaluate the redactable blockchain through extensive experiments.

These principles promote transparency, accountability, and independent validation of FL processes. Incorporating auditability and verifiability is imperative for building trust and ensuring the robustness of FL methodologies. Typical FL architectures rely on a trustworthy central authority to manage the FL process. However, reliance on a central authority could become a single point of failure, making it an attractive target for cyber-attacks and insider frauds. Moreover, the central entity lacks auditability and verifiability, which undermines the privacy and security that FL aims to ensure. This article proposes an auditable and verifiable decentralized FL (DFL) framework. We first develop a smart-contract-based monitoring system for DFL participants. This monitoring system is then deployed to each DFL participant and executed when the local model training is initiated. The monitoring system records necessary information during the local training process for auditing purposes. Afterward, each DFL participant sends the local model and monitoring system to the respective blockchain node. The blockchain nodes representing each DFL participant exchange the local models and use the monitoring system to validate each local model. To ensure an auditable and verifiable decentralized aggregation procedure, we record the aggregation steps taken by each blockchain node in the aggregation contract. Following the aggregation phase, each blockchain node applies a multisignature scheme to the aggregated model, producing a globally verifiable model. Based on the signed global model and the aggregation contract, each blockchain node implements a consensus protocol to store the validated global model in tamper-proof storage. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we conducted a series of experiments with different machine learning architectures and datasets, including CIFAR-10, F-MNIST, and MedMNIST. The experimental results indicate a slight increase in time consumption compared with the state-of-the-art, serving as a tradeoff to ensure auditability and verifiability.

In MCs, MSMEs share their manufacturing resources for order-driven cross-enterprise production cooperation, which is supported through blockchain-based order tracking. However, the application of blockchain also brings concerns about data security and privacy protection to MSMEs, which leads to disputes between MSMEs about which data should be stored in the blockchain. For this problem, a granular-computing-based data-sharing decision-making (GrC-DSDM) method is proposed. In the GrC-DSDM method, a fuzzy proximity relationship is used to describe the familiarity between MSMEs in the same MC, and MC familiarity is obtained based on the granular space derived from the fuzzy proximity relation. A fuzzy preference relation is used to representMSMEs\u2019 preferences for all metadata related to the order, and a group decision-making method is applied to calculate the preference values for all metadata. Through constructing the mapping relationship between MC familiarity and preference values of all metadata, we can determine which metadata should be shared with the MC for blockchain-based order tracking.

As emerging technologies, edge computing enables real-time processing and analysis on devices situated closer to the data source while reducing bandwidth requirements. Blockchain, being decentralized, could enhance data security. Therefore, edge computing and blockchain are integrated in IIoT to reduce latency and improve security. However, the inefficient data transmission of blockchain leads to increased transmission latency in the IIoT. To address this issue, we propose a cluster-based data transmission strategy (CDTS) for blockchain network. Initially, an improved weighted label propagation algorithm (WLPA) is proposed for clustering blockchain nodes. Subsequently, a spanning tree topology construction (STTC) is designed to simplify the blockchain network topology, based on the above node clustering results.

This paper considers a Blockchain-enabled MEC scenario where CE devices can offload tasks to multiple-UAV-edge layers for decentralized cooperative computing, and utilize the reputation mechanism of blockchain to identify abnormal nodes in edge offloading.

However, with the increasing adoption of AVs, guaranteeing the accuracy and security of their sensory systems is becoming paramount. Specifically, the vulnerability of these systems to malware and sensor faults can pose significant risks to the dependable and secure operation of the vehicle. To identify and combat these issues we propose a stream-based Blockchain-powered Malicious Node Detection (BMND) method to analyze and report any malicious activity of the AV operating as a node on the Internet of Autonomous Vehicles (IoAV) network, wherein the existing solutions are at lower latency. BMND involves the detection of sensor anomalies and defects post-production of the AV. In the case that malware or any other malicious software is detected on the onboard compute unit it is isolated and contained, and the AV will be classified as malicious until appropriate remedial measures are taken to deter any sharing of erroneous or malicious data. When the AV is deemed safe from malware and defects in the system then a block is mined by the AV node and a unique ID is assigned to allow data transfers on the blockchain with other nodes. Only active nodes with assigned IDs and available blocks for transactions on the blockchain influence AV decision-making. BMND would allow modern AVs on the road to effectively communicate with reliable information. Experimental analysis shows that the malware detection in BMND is 4.4% more accurate with an F1-score of\n\u223c\n0.99 as compared to previous and other current state-of-the-art methods, and the communication capabilities of BMND are also better regarding security and latency concerning proposed vanilla blockchain methods.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TITS.2024.3433480", "Date of Publication": "06 August 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "1524-9050", "Electronic ISSN": "1558-0016"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Sahaya Beni Prathiba", "labs": ["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Centre for Cyber Physical Systems, Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai, India"]}, {"name": "Pranav Murali", "labs": ["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai, India"]}, {"name": "Rajalakshmi Shenbaga Moorthy", "labs": ["Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research, Chennai, India"]}, {"name": "Deepak Kumar Anandhan", "labs": ["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, St. Joseph\u2019s Institute of Technology, Chennai, India"]}, {"name": "Arikumar K.

This research proposes blockchain as a unique method for securing patient-related data access and integrating homomorphic encryption with an end-to-end privacy-protecting system. In this research, we propose a blockchain-based architecture for identifying security threats in personal medical devices to address the existing issues related to healthcare devices.

With the development of quantum computers, blockchains traditionally used for traceability struggle to guarantee the authenticity of data. Furthermore, only chained blocks have been used in previous traceability systems, which has resulted in a full backup for each business unit in the supply chain, wasting storage resources significantly. Another problem is that there are differences in the data structure and consensus mechanisms of each unit, which makes maintenance difficult. To address these problems, it is encouraging to create a new blockchain with high scalability and resistance to quantum attacks. This paper innovatively proposes a quantum hybrid blockchain-based data authenticity framework (QHB-DA) with five layers, which not only accomplishes traceability, but also has assurance that data can withstand verification. In QHB-DA, blockchain utilizes a combination of DAG and chained structures to reduce data redundancy, in which quantum hashes are performed to connect blocks. Algorithms ED-QKD and D2B-QSC are designed to keep the information from being leaked during transmission and format conversion. Through cost-benifit analysis, security analysis and empirical experiments, feasibility of quantum hashing and the attack resistance of the QHB-DA are demonstrated, which can reduce storage wastage and completely implement the data authenticity.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/JIOT.2024.3479450", "Date of Publication": "14 October 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal"}, "issn_info": {"Electronic ISSN": "2327-4662"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Kening Zhang", "labs": ["Hung Hom, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong"]}, {"name": "Carman K.

Traditional methodologies such as public key infrastructure provide services for verifying the legitimacy of entities with certificates. However, even if a vehicle is legally registered, trust in its behavior is not always assured. Recently decentralized trust management systems (DTMS) are proposed to solve the trust issue. However, achieving both dependability and efficiency remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel DTMS based on the consortium blockchain. We in particular focus on the dependability of trust evaluation, where trust computation is performed on both vehicles and RSUs. To achieve a sustainable trust environment, we propose an incentive model whereby the raters can earn rewards for providing honest ratings. Instead of utilizing the consensus algorithm based on the Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS), we implement a verifiable delay function (VDF)-based consensus model within the trusted execution environment (TEE) to ensure efficiency and security for the consortium blockchain. In addition, we design a smart contract on top of the blockchain to assist the system in detecting a specific attack against the trust system, known as the on-off attack.

Existing options contract protocols have the following two weaknesses: (i) The buyer have to lock his asset during the contract's lifespan, incurring heavy opportunity costs; (ii) Turing-completed smart contract (TCSC)/hash time lock contract (HTLC) is required to exchange assets, which restricts applicability as TCSC/HTLC is supported by a limited number of blockchains.

We construct UP-BLOC using a buyer-pay-first design, and propose a blockchain-based secret storage mechanism to ensure the security of the assets involved. This allows the buyer to engage in an options contract without locking any asset and resulting opportunity costs, and thus is more practical than existing works. Besides, UP-BLOC achieves the exchange of assets using standard digital signatures instead of TCSC/HTLC. Hence, UP-BLOC is compatible with all blockchains and is universal.

Blockchain is an ideal technological method to solve the above issues. When implementing consumer IoT with blockchain, the privacy protection in consumer electronics is a core issue that needs to be addressed. The threshold identity-based ring signature (TIBRS) not only prevents the data stored on the blockchain from being altered but also offers privacy protection for consumer electronics. However, most existing TIBRS protocols rely on key generation center (KGC), which makes these protocols vulnerable to system intrusion. Furthermore, only a handful of protocols succeed in achieving identity abort.

By leveraging the benefits of both MuSig and threshold identity-based ring signature, we construct an efficient threshold identity-based ring signature protocol that eliminates the need for KGC.

By classifying the users into dynamic energy consumption classes to reward energy efficiency and penalize excessive use, users can modify their behavior to pass to a less expensive and more virtuous consumption class. To this aim, a blockchain platform determines the rewards and penalties and, by a K-means clustering algorithm, categorizes users into respective groups. Then, a Class Follower Problem is formulated and solved by a Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory network as a predictive model. If the users follow the suggestions proposed by the controller, i.e., the thermostat set-points and the time intervals in which the HVAC system must be switched off or on, the users can be located in a more virtuous consumption class.

Electric vehicles with various sensors and IoT devices are susceptible to physical damage and attacks. To address these challenges and provide robust financial support to policyholders, an enhanced blockchain-based electric vehicle insurance policy (BE-VIP) is proposed to cover vehicle damages.

Protecting and preserving the digital evidence extracted from mobile devices is a high priority for investigators. The investigation task will become much more complicated if this evidence is lost or tampered with during the process of investigating. Several traditional preservation mechanisms have been proposed to preserve the integrity of the mobile evidence from being tampered with or altered in any way. However, these mechanisms are specific and not sufficient to maintain mobile evidence integrity reliably. Accordingly, the motivation of this study is to analyze mobile devices from the preservation evidence perspective, and then develop a preservation metamodel for preserving mobile evidence using blockchain technology. The scope of this study covers the development of a complete preservation metamodel using metamodeling approach based on blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is a secure and immutable protocol that offers a consistent and transparent way for storing and accessing mobile evidence in a secure and immutable manner. The meta-modeling approach was used to construct the preservation metamodel in this paper. The results showed that the developed preservation meta-model has the ability to instantiate/derive several solution models for preservation purposes. The model was found more comprehensive than any of the existing models proposed in the field of mobile forensics.

To address these issues, a permissioned blockchain is used to build a secure and reliable data-sharing platform among participating terminals, replacing the central aggregator in the traditional FL called blockchain-based federated learning.

Malicious participants may upload low-quality data or compromise data privacy during model aggregation. To address these issues, we propose the Federated Reputation Evaluation Blockchain (FREB), which integrates a reputation evaluation mechanism with blockchain technology. By leveraging blockchain, FL tasks are executed through trusted transactions, with smart contracts ensuring transparency and accountability. In contrast to traditional contribution evaluation methods, FREB employs a multi-weight subjective logic model combined with Shapley values to assess participant reliability.

One key concern is that the computing power of any Internet of Things (IoT) device is relatively low, hence mechanisms that require low computational power are appropriate for designing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). In this research work, a blockchain IDS coalition is proposed for securing IoMT networks and devices. The blockchain ledger is compact and uses less processing resources. Additionally, the ledger requires less communication overhead. The cryptographic hashes in the suggested architecture ensure complete data secrecy and integrity between parties who are trusted and those who are untrustworthy. Peer-to-peer networks in both central and cluster networks are also included in this work for complete decentralization. The proposed model can counter various attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS), anonymity attacks, impersonation attacks, Man-In-The-Middle (MITM), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The proposed method achieved an F1- score as high as 100% and reported an AUC value of over 99%.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/JBHI.2023.3325964", "Date of Publication": "19 October 2023", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "2168-2194", "Electronic ISSN": "2168-2208"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Karan Gupta", "labs": ["Department of Information Technology, Netaji Subhas University of Technology, New Delhi, India"]}, {"name": "Koyel Datta Gupta", "labs": ["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Maharaja Surajmal Institute of Technology, New Delhi, India"]}, {"name": "Devender Kumar", "labs": ["Department of Information Technology, Netaji Subhas University of Technology, New Delhi, India"]}, {"name": "Gautam Srivastava", "labs": ["Dept. of Math and Computer Science, Brandon University, Canada"]}, {"name": "Deepak Kumar Sharma", "labs": ["Department of Information Technology, Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, Delhi, India"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Blockchains", "Medical services", "Security", "Computer architecture", "Bioinformatics", "Peer-to-peer computing", "Internet of Medical Things"], "Author Keywords": ["Internet of Medical Things", "Intrusion Detection", "Tree Classifier", "Security", "Blockchain"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f4749b2", "Title": "Quantum Secure Authentication Scheme for Internet of Medical Things Using Blockchain", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643610/", "Abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a compelling networking paradigm integrating wireless communications sensors, connected devices, and embedded computing technologies.

In this paper, we propose a one-stop knowledge acquisition ecosystem termed BWKA that covers the whole process from upper-layer knowledge trading to underlying knowledge generation. In the knowledge trading process, the knowledge-as-a-service platform (KSP) is the buyer and publishes knowledge demands to multiple local knowledge sellers (LKSs).

However, the FL aggregation server faces a challenge in waiting for a large volume of model parameters from selected nodes before generating a global model, which leads to inefficient communication and aggregation. Although transmitting only the signs of stochastic gradient descent (SignSGD) reduces the transmission load, it decreases model accuracy, and the time waiting for local model collection remains substantial. Moreover, the security of FL is severely compromised by prevalent poisoning, backdoor, and DDoS attacks, causing ineffective and inaccurate model training. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a B lockchain-based A synchronous S ign S GD (BASS) architecture for efficient and secure federated learning. By integrating a blockchain-based semi-asynchronous aggregation scheme with sign-based gradient compression, BASS considerably improves communication and aggregation efficiency, while providing resistance against attacks. Besides, a novel node-summarized sign aggregation algorithm is developed for the blockchain leaders to ensure the convergence and accuracy of the global model.

However, security issues caused by deliberate attacks in distributed systems and efficiency issues induced by heterogeneous computing consumption in resource-limited systems need to be urgently addressed in BFL. To address these issues, we propose a Decentralized Reputation Management (DRM) mechanism for a Trustworthy BFL (T-BFL) network, that explores, stores, and utilizes the endogenous reputation of distributed nodes to promote system security and efficiency. The proposed DRM includes three core modules, i.e., decentralized reputation evaluation, reputation-based model aggregation, and reputation-based blockchain consensus. Specifically, in the off-chain phase of T-BFL, the reputation value of each node is evaluated based on model quality, which other peer nodes can verify. This reputation value further determines the weight of global aggregation at each node. In the on-chain phase, the reputation of each node serves as the stake to dynamically adjust its consensus difficulty. Furthermore, we investigate the convergence rate of the T-BFL network under the poisoning attack, and dynamically optimize the energy allocation of local training, consensus, and communications by minimizing the upper bound of the global loss function. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of T-BFL on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Cifar-10 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with traditional BFL, T-BFL can achieve up to 56.12% accuracy improvement and 8.6\u00d7 acceleration for reaching the target learning accuracy under the poisoning attack.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/JIOT.2024.3480995", "Date of Publication": "16 October 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal"}, "issn_info": {"Electronic ISSN": "2327-4662"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Weihao Zhu", "labs": ["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"]}, {"name": "Long Shi", "labs": ["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"]}, {"name": "Jun Li", "labs": ["School of Electronic and Optical Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"]}, {"name": "Bin Cao", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Kang Wei", "labs": ["Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"]}, {"name": "Zhe Wang", "labs": ["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"]}, {"name": "Tao Huang", "labs": ["College of Science and Engineering, James Cook University, Cairns, QLD, Australia"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Blockchains", "Training", "Peer-to-peer computing", "Data models", "Servers", "Security", "Resource management", "Internet of Things", "Energy consumption", "Convergence"], "Author Keywords": ["Federated learning", "blockchain", "decentralized reputation management", "energy allocation"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f4749be", "Title": "BFKD: Blockchain-Based Federated Knowledge Distillation for Aviation Internet of Things", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10734382/", "Abstract": "Aviation Internet of Things (AIoT) data sharing can create tremendous value for participants.

Further, to minimize the storage on blockchain, it is desired that the aggregated public-key and the aggregated signature are both as short as possible. In this paper, we find a compiler that converts a kind of identification (ID) scheme (which we call a linear ID) to a multi-signature so that both the aggregated public-key and the aggregated signature have a size independent of the number of signers. Our compiler is provably secure. The advantage of our result is that we reduce a multi-party problem to a weakly secure two-party problem. We realize our compiler with two ID schemes.

Users, together with the channels, form a graph known as the off-chain network topology. The off-chain topology and the payment characteristics affect network performance such as the average number of intermediate users a payment is routed through or the values of transaction fees.

Nonetheless, these approaches prioritize storage optimization by minimizing the query cost and lack control over storage cost. Furthermore, these approaches overlook the relationships between network users, thus failing to fully measure the future query cost. Thus, this paper proposes BSSN, a Blockchain Storage technology based on Social Networks. The combined use of storage cost and query cost is introduced for the first time to formulate the Node Allocation Optimization (NAO) problem, and the Multi-population Genetic Ant Colony (MGAC) algorithm will be employed to derive node allocation strategies. Specifically, we address three technical challenges. (i) To predict the transactions that nodes will participate in in the future, we employ the social ties to obtain the access frequencies among users. (ii) To strike a balance between the storage cost and query cost, we jointly model the two costs as a multi-objective optimization problem to formulate the NAO problem. (iii) To solve the NP-hard NAO problem, we use MGAC algorithm, where the storage and query populations collaboratively search for solutions based on four operations.

Blockchain technology enables privacy preservation for medical data through encryption. However, conventional data encryption hampers data analysis and sharing, and decrypted data still carries the risk of leakage. Homomorphic encryption is a technique that allows computation directly on encrypted data without decryption, thus reducing the risk of data leakage during sharing. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based privacy preservation and sharing scheme for healthcare IoT data. First, we use an improved homomorphic encryption technique to encrypt and process electronic health records (EHRs), optimizing the modular exponentiation process with a fast exponentiation algorithm, enabling users to efficiently perform data computation and analysis while keeping the data encrypted. Second, we employ symmetric searchable encryption (SSE) to encrypt homomorphic keys and user identity information, and use a Bloom filter as the mapping structure between data keywords and unique identifiers. This approach enhances search efficiency while preserving data privacy, allowing for secure search and analysis on ciphertext. Finally, smart contracts are designed to implement access control during the data-sharing process, increasing the security and transparency of data sharing. Experimental results show that the proposed homomorphic encryption scheme reduces the encryption and decryption time by an average of 34% under different key sizes, while the optimized SSE technique keeps ciphertext retrieval time at a constant level. The proposed scheme provides an effective solution for secure and efficient data analysis and retrieval, ensuring privacy preservation for the secure use and sharing of medical data.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/JIOT.2024.3487154", "Date of Publication": "28 October 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Internet of Things Journal"}, "issn_info": {"Electronic ISSN": "2327-4662"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Shaopeng Guan", "labs": ["School of Information and Electronic Engineering, Shandong Technology and Business University, China"]}, {"name": "Youliang Cao", "labs": ["School of Information and Electronic Engineering, Shandong Technology and Business University, China"]}, {"name": "Yuan Zhang", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Data privacy", "Cryptography", "Blockchains", "Homomorphic encryption", "Medical services", "Protection", "Security", "Medical diagnostic imaging", "Information filters", "Internet of Things"], "Author Keywords": ["Healthcare IoT", "Privacy Preservation", "Data Sharing", "Blockchain", "Homomorphic Encryption"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f4749d1", "Title": "BFFDT: Blockchain-based Fair and Fine-Grained Data Trading Using Proxy Re-Encryption and Verifiable Commitment", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10646357/", "Abstract": "Fair data trading is a complex process that is often hindered by a fundamental issue of trust between data suppliers and collectors.

However, the surge in transactions has led to heightened relations between nodes in the system, reflecting the volume of transactions between them. The increase in related nodes engaging in identical transactions across diverse shards leads to substantial cross-shard transactions, contributing to communication delays and impeding enhancements in throughput. Current methods typically employ greedy or heuristic approaches to organize nodes into shards, resulting in marginal reductions in the total relation between related nodes in different shards (i.e., the number of cross-shard transactions), while causing shard imbalance. Hence, there is a crucial need for periodic shard reorganization based on node relations to minimize the total relation between related nodes across different shards while ensuring shard balance. In this article, we investigate the reorganization of nodes into shards based on node relations in sharding blockchains, aiming to minimize the total relation between related nodes in different shards.We formulate the shard reorganization problem and introduce the shard reorganization algorithm based on the relation between nodes (SRRN) to address this issue. Theoretical analysis proves that SRRN is a 2\u03bb M -approximation algorithm, where \u03bb=( r max / r min ), with M representing the number of shards, and r max and r min denoting the maximum and minimum nonzero relations between nodes, respectively.

However, this sector faces changing demands and complex supply chains due to the management of rapid technological advancements and consumer expectations. Seamless communication between suppliers and consumers is essential to optimize production processes, minimize waste, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. In response to these demands, this paper presents a solution that combines Digital Twins (DT) and blockchain to improve security and efficiency in metaverse-inspired consumer-oriented supply chains. Herein, DT is used to represent products in virtual spaces and blockchain secures sensitive information using encryption and access controls. Our objective is to create a transparent, secure, and user-friendly system where consumers and suppliers can interact in real-time to verify product details and access important information of featured tasks like warranties and payment settlement. Smart contracts automates these tasks to make processes faster and more reliable. Through experiments, we tested how well the system maintains product integrity, authenticates transactions, and supports consumer-oriented supply chain (CSC) operations.

However, concerns regarding privacy and security are on the rise as huge amounts of data are aggregated to form large models (LMs). Although federated learning (FL), which trains and updates a model without sharing the actual datasets, has been intensively researched to prevent privacy breaches, there are still potential security threats like a single point of failure and intentional tampering with malicious data. This is because of the vulnerability of a central curator and a lack of authentication. As participants, they (i.e., vehicles) may unintentionally update low-quality data caused by poor wireless connectivity, unstable availability, and insufficient training datasets. They may also intentionally update unreliable data to carry out poisoning attacks. The divergence among local models, trained on non-independent and identically distributed ( non-IID) data, can slow convergence and diminish model accuracy when these models are aggregated. Therefore, it is important to carefully select trustworthy participants. In this paper, we propose a new reliable and secure federated learning for IoV based on decentralized blockchain and reputation management. To cope with a single point of failure, injection of malicious data, and lack of authentication while ensuring privacy and traceability, our scheme combines blockchain and a lightweight digital signature. Moreover, we employ the concept of the reputation of vehicles to select suitable participants with reliability, ultimately improving accuracy. Security analysis results, including comparisons with previous works, prove that the proposed scheme can address security concerns. The results of performance evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TVT.2024.3456852", "Date of Publication": "16 September 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "0018-9545", "Electronic ISSN": "1939-9359"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Hyeran Mun", "labs": ["Center for Cyber-Physical Systems, Department of Computer Science, Khalifa University, UAE"]}, {"name": "Kyusuk Han", "labs": ["Secure System Research Center (SSRC), Technology Innovation Institute (TII), UAE"]}, {"name": "Hyun Ku Yeun", "labs": ["Mathematics at the School of Engineering and Technology, Higher Colleges of Technology, UAE"]}, {"name": "Ernesto Damiani", "labs": ["Center for Cyber-Physical Systems, Department of Computer Science, Khalifa University, UAE"]}, {"name": "Deepak Puthal", "labs": ["Indian Institute of Management Bodh Gaya, India"]}, {"name": "Tae-Yeon Kim", "labs": ["Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Khalifa University, UAE"]}, {"name": "Chan Yeob Yeun", "labs": ["Center for Cyber-Physical Systems, Department of Computer Science, Khalifa University, UAE"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Data models", "Servers", "Security", "Blockchains", "Authentication", "Reliability", "Computational modeling"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "Federated learning (FL)", "Internet of Vehicles (IoV)", "Large models (LMs)", "Privacy", "Reputation", "Security,"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f4749e1", "Title": "Blockchain and FL-Based Secure Architecture for Enhanced External Intrusion Detection in Smart Farming", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714358/", "Abstract": "Smart farming influences advanced technologies to optimize agricultural procedures, yet it meets significant cybersecurity challenges, particularly in External Intrusion Detection (EID).

To address this challenge, we propose a novel RGB-T tracking model named MCTrack, from the perspective of leveraging correlation among modalities. First, during the feature extraction stage, we design a novel module based on channel matching modeling to construct bidirectional channel context information flow for two modalities. By leveraging information flow, specific modalities correlation information can be transmitted to two modes, augmenting the correlation between the two modes adaptively. Subsequently, after the feature extraction network, the features of each modality are decoded and transformed to generate more correlated feature representations. During this stage, we extract distinctive and collective features by leveraging the correlation among modalities. Then fusing these features and generated search region features specifically for localization. This aids the model in comprehending the correlation between RGB and TIR under complex scenarios, thereby enhancing its ability to capture and utilize key features.

To ensure privacy, differential privacy is applied in FL by clipping and adding noise to local gradients (i.e., Local Differential Privacy (LDP)) or the global model update (i.e., Central Differential Privacy (CDP)). However, the effectiveness of DP in defending GLAs needs to be thoroughly investigated since some works briefly verify that DP can guard FL against GLAs while others question its defense capability. In this paper, we empirically evaluate CDP and LDP on the resistance of GLAs, and pay close attention to the trade-offs between privacy and utility in FL. Our findings reveal that 1) existing GLAs can be defended by CDP using a per-layer clipping strategy and LDP with a reasonable privacy guarantee; 2) both CDP and LDP ensure the trade-off between privacy and utility in training shallow model, but cannot guarantee this trade-off in deeper model training (e.g., ResNets). Triggered by the crucial role of clipping operation for DP, we propose an improved attack that incorporates the clipping operation into existing GLAs without requiring additional information. The experimental results show our attack can destruct the protection of CDP and weaken the effectiveness of LDP. Overall, our work validates the effectiveness as well as reveals the vulnerability of DP under GLAs. We hope this work can provide guidance on utilizing DP for defending against GLA in FL and inspire the design of future privacy-preserving FL.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TMC.2024.3417930", "Date of Publication": "24 June 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "1536-1233", "Electronic ISSN": "1558-0660"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Jiahui Hu", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}, {"name": "Jiacheng Du", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}, {"name": "Zhibo Wang", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}, {"name": "Xiaoyi Pang", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}, {"name": "Yajie Zhou", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}, {"name": "Peng Sun", "labs": ["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China"]}, {"name": "Kui Ren", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Servers", "Privacy", "Differential privacy", "Data models", "Training data", "Training", "TV"], "Author Keywords": ["Federated learning", "differential privacy", "gradient leakage attack"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f4749ec", "Title": "Blockchain-Based Renewable Energy Trading Using Information Entropy Theory", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10035496/", "Abstract": "Renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EVs) are widely recognized as primary ways to reduce carbon emissions and essential components of low-carbon power systems.

The security of data exchanges in vehicular networks currently relies on a centralized architecture that is responsible for managing various security services such as authentication, confidentiality, non-repudiation, real-time misbehavior detection, certificate management and revocation. However, this centralized approach can be challenging and costly for authorities, and it may even weaken the network's overall security. In this paper, we propose a complementary solution that uses a decentralized security framework to help authorities better manage their network security by involving each vehicle in the overall security management. Our framework, TileChain, is blockchain based solution that use road information to manage the network's security dynamically. The architecture is designed to optimize any security service efficiently. To demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our proposed solution, we selected certificate revocation as a critical service and performed simulations using real vehicle traffic data provided by The French road operator DIR Nord. Our Smart Contract achieved an accuracy of 81.3% in misbehavior detection, leading to certificate revocation. Furthermore, the computation load for security management by authorities potentially reduced by a factor of 96.8%.

Most existing fairness-aware incentive mechanisms distribute rewards to FL clients by quantifying their contributions to the performance of the global model. Essentially, these mechanisms pursue contribution fairness, namely a constant contribution-reward ratio across FL clients, with an implicit assumption that clients would be satisfied with the contribution fairness. However, research in social psychology has confirmed that this assumption may not hold in many real-world scenarios. According to equity theory proposed by Adams, an individual's assessment and perception of receiving fair treatment significantly depend on the input-outcome ratio, where outcome simply refers to the rewards, while input is far more complex because it involves a bunch of subtle factors such as enthusiasm, experience and tolerance as well as the estimated contributions. Inspired by Adams' equity theory, in this work, we expand the notion of contribution fairness to input fairness and propose a new fairness-aware incentive mechanism named FairReward that distributes rewards under the joint consideration of self-reported inputs and computed contributions. FairReward employs a reputation mechanism to enhance the credibility of self-reported inputs and leverages blockchains to eliminate the need of a trusted FL server and monetarily incentivize/penalize clients.

In order to overcome these problems, this research is introducing a novel approach which is utilizing the decentralized data collection through Blockchain nodes and also utilizing evolutionary genetic algorithm for designing a native path plan considering multiple constraints and objectives. The multiple factors include start location, dynamic driving information, road conditions and vehicle waiting time on the road due to signals and traffic. To optimize the native path planning, a multi-objective road planning process is designed for smart vehicles which minimize the computational overhead using a multi-step genetic algorithm. The evolutionary algorithm utilizes a fitness function for multi-objective native path planning by selecting the genetic operators carefully. The proposed GA based evolutionary approach efficiently determines the optimal path for smart vehicles. The obtained path nodes are compared against multiple objective and constraints to define the optimal path across all road sections; ultimately this process is yielding a series of nodes that formulate the optimal path. The empirical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed evolutionary method with respect to the optimal path planning, convergence speed in attaining the fitness function and negligible training error.

However, most of the existing data collection studies use CRH to calculate the truth value, which is difficult to guarantee the data accuracy. The proposed privacy-preserving service methods either neglect the truth-value computation or still adopt the CRH method. To solve the challenge, we propose a Reputation and Privacy-Preserving Service based Truth Data Collection (RPPS-TDC) scheme to achieve the privacy-preserving accurate data collection for MCS. RPPS-TDC scheme consists of two steps: worker trust calculation and reputation-based truth value calculation. Firstly, data requester performs the initial weights calculation on the received data using DBCRH method. Secondly, reputation center uses the initial weights to update the reputation, which is based on the trustworthy worker inference. Finally, the workers are reweighted according to their reputation. We select workers based on trust_MaxHeap, thus obtaining more accurate data. At the same time, we give workers payments based on their trust weights.

The diversity and volume of samples play a crucial role in a model\u2019s performance. Achieving this requires collaboration among multiple clients rather than relying on a single source to construct the training dataset. Which, in turn, introduces new challenges related to the security and privacy of the clients\u2019 data. While federated learning has been developed to address user privacy concerns to some extent, it is essential to recognize that existing methods have limitations. These methods can\u2019t fully guarantee the fairness and trustworthiness of federated tasks. To address these problems, we designed a federated learning framework based on blockchain. This framework ensures a trustworthy federated computation process and fairly evaluates each client\u2019s contribution.\nFederated learning enables cooperative computation between multiple participants while protecting user privacy. Currently, federated learning algorithms assume that all participants are trustworthy and their systems are secure. However, the following problems arise in real-world scenarios: (1) Malicious clients disrupt federated learning through model poisoning and data poisoning attacks. Although some research has proposed secure aggregation methods to solve this problem, most methods have limitations. (2) Due to the variance in data quality and computational resources among participants, rewards cannot be distributed equally. Some clients also exhibit free-rider behavior, seeking to cheat the reward system and manipulate global models. Evaluating client contribution and distributing rewards also present challenges.\nTo address these challenges, we design a trustworthy federated framework to ensure secure computing throughout the federated task process. First, we propose a malicious model detection method for secure model aggregation. Then, we also propose a fair method of assessing contribution to identify client-side free-riding behavior. Lastly, we develop a computation process grounded in blockchain and smart contracts to guarantee the trustworthiness and fairness of federated tasks. To validate the performance of our framework, we simulate different types of client attacks and contribution evaluation scenarios on several open-source datasets.

However, ensuring the assurance of the correct operation of the distributed mechanisms is also essential but has received less attention. A common assumption is that all participants in the P2P market are honest and make reasonable bids at market prices. Such an assumption could be risky because the P2P market clearing process relies on a coordination process of market participants and the clearing outcome of the P2P market is susceptible to manipulation by dishonest participants. In this work, we propose a new architecture for the P2P market by adding a verification layer based on zero-knowledge proof technology to identify dishonest bidding information of market participants without collecting their private cost information. In addition, we introduce an asynchronous market mechanism, which can greatly guide the P2P market clearing results in a dishonest environment to be close to the theoretical optimal results.

However, the blockchain consensus for secure task offloading inevitably increases the communication and computation resource consumption. More importantly, the frequent handover among roadside units during the fast movement of vehicles also raises the communication cost for blockchain consensus. To address these issues, this paper proposes intelligent secure task offloading and caching (ISTOC) scheme for VEC networks. Specifically, we first establish a digital twin-assisted VEC network that migrates the blockchain consensus process from the physical space to the cyber space, supporting the dynamic handover of vehicles. Correspondingly, we propose a lightweight blockchain scheme named diffused delegated Byzantine fault tolerance (d2BFT). Then, aiming at simultaneously reducing the task processing latency and improving the blockchain transaction throughput, we formulate the joint blockchain, communication, computation, and caching (B3C) optimization problem subject to task division, communication bandwidth, computing frequency, cache storage, task deadline, and blockchain stability. Due to the non-convexity of B3C, we transform it into a Markov decision process, and propose a multi-agent double actor-critic (MADAC) algorithm in light of the distributed characteristic of blockchain. Through offline training and online execution, we jointly optimize the task division, communication bandwidth, computing frequency and cache storage allocation, block size, and block generation interval for ISTOC. Experimental results show that the proposed MADAC-based ISTOC scheme can stably converge with a much higher reward than the benchmark schemes based on MADDPG, SAC, DDPG, and TD3.

Unfortunately, current tools face a significant limitation in their capacity to adapt and detect these evolving Reentrancy patterns. Consequently, ensuring precise and highly extensible Reentrancy vulnerability detection remains critical challenges for existing tools. To address this issue, we propose a tool named ReEP, designed to reduce the false positives for Reentrancy vulnerability detection.

It evaluates results from existing tools to verify vulnerability likelihood and reduce false positives. ReEP also offers excellent extensibility, enabling the integration of different detection tools to enhance precision and cover different vulnerability attack patterns. We perform ReEP to eight existing state-of-the-art Reentrancy detection tools. The average precision of these eight tools increased from the original 0.5% to 73% without sacrificing recall.

However, most existing tracking methods are still limited in designing different components to separately employ corresponding cues and even ignore one of them. This makes them difficult to maintain effective interaction between different cues, thus hindering the models from fostering a comprehensive understanding of the target objects. To address these issues, we propose a unified spatio-temporal cues learning framework (named USCLTrack) that comprehensively mines the variation patterns of targets between consecutive frames in complex video streams. Specifically, USCLTrack firstly aggregates motion and appearance cues into shared queries to provide the bridge of interaction between both cues. Then, it directly generates object locations on the condition of these shared queries in an autoregressive manner, unifying different cues to guide future inferences. To effectively learn multiple spatio-temporal cues aggregated in the shared queries, we develop a spatio-temporal attention mechanism.

Consequently, these technological approaches prove impractical within intricate driving environments. In this paper, we introduce a shadow based non-line-of-sight moving obstacle detection system devised to augment Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), ensuring adequate time for safe response and halting. Our approach incorporates a shadow signal discriminator tailored to evaluate faint shadows generated by moving obstacles, such as pedestrians within blind spots.

We comprehensively assess our methodology's adaptability by employing datasets acquired from real-world driving scenarios encompassing diverse road surfaces and lighting conditions.

This bottom-up attention mechanism leads to an emphasis on all objects in the input images, rather than the task related objects. As a result, the performance of the bottom-up attention based trackers is deteriorated in complicated scenes. To address this issue, we propose a robust tracker that combines bottom-up attention with top-down attention to comply with the existing ViT framework, named TBTrack. TBTrack can not only utilize the existing bottom-up attention mechanisms to model the long-range relationship of input tokens, but also utilize a newly added top-down attention mechanism to pay more attention to task related object and further eliminate interference from similar objects and backgrounds. Specifically, we firstly design a top-down prior generation module using an adaptive learning parameter combined with the template inputs to obtain top-down task guided signals. Then, we inject the prior signals into a bottom-up attention module to obtain a top-down and bottom-up attention combination block (TB-Block). Finally, we stack these TB-Blocks to construct our tracker (TBTrack) with top-down prior guidance capability, which focuses more on the task related object.

This study utilizes the reinforcement learning (RL) method to obtain supervisory policies for opacity enforcement in the case when the automaton model of the system is unavailable. The state space of the environment in the RL is dynamically generated through system simulation. Actions are defined according to the control patterns of the SCT. A reward function is proposed to evaluate whether the secret is exposed or not. Then, a sequence of state-action-reward chains are obtained as system simulation goes on. The frameworks of Q-learning and State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) algorithms are adopted to implement the proposed approach. The goal of the training is to maximize the total accumulative reward by optimizing the action selection in the learning process. Then, an optimal supervisory policy is obtained when the training process converges. Experiments are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The contributions are two aspects. Firstly, a supervisor for opacity enforcement is learned by RL training without an explicit formal model of the system. Secondly, the ability of the proposed method in computing supervisory policies without formal models addresses a significant gap in the literature and offers a new direction for research in opacity enforcement in discrete event systems. Note to Practitioners \u2014Supervisory Control Theory (SCT) supplies an effective way to synthesize supervisors, which traditionally handles tasks with explicit system models for current-state opacity enforcement by restricting behavior of systems. However, formal models of systems are often confidential or otherwise unavailable. This paper presents a method for supervisor synthesis via reinforcement learning in the case of lacking formal models of systems. The proposed method leverages the characteristics of control patterns in SCT and optimizes the action selection in the training process through a reward mechanism that evaluates the secrecy of states. The approach can be applied to model-free RL frameworks such as Q-learning and State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) algorithms. The training is performed as the system simulation goes on. When the training process converges, the optimal policy can be used to enforce opacity for the system. However, Q-table is used to save the Q-value in both Q-learning and SARSA algorithms. In the worst case, the size of the Q-table grows exponentially with the number of states and controllable events increasing. This can lead to memory exhaustion when the system\u2019s scale is large. To make the approach scalable, we will attempt to use DRL to train control policies for opacity enforcement in the future.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TASE.2024.3456239", "Date of Publication": "17 September 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "1545-5955", "Electronic ISSN": "1558-3783"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Huimin Zhang", "labs": ["Key Laboratory of Education Blockchain and Intelligent Technology, Ministry of Education, and Guangxi Key Laboratory of Multi-Source Information Mining and Security, Guangxi Normal University, Guilin, China"]}, {"name": "Li Huang", "labs": ["Key Laboratory of Education Blockchain and Intelligent Technology, Ministry of Education, and Guangxi Key Laboratory of Multi-Source Information Mining and Security, Guangxi Normal University, Guilin, China"]}, {"name": "Wanling Huang", "labs": ["Key Laboratory of Education Blockchain and Intelligent Technology, Ministry of Education, and Guangxi Key Laboratory of Multi-Source Information Mining and Security, Guangxi Normal University, Guilin, China"]}, {"name": "Lei Feng", "labs": ["Department of Machine Design, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"]}, {"name": "Xianxian Li", "labs": ["Key Laboratory of Education Blockchain and Intelligent Technology, Ministry of Education, and Guangxi Key Laboratory of Multi-Source Information Mining and Security, Guangxi Normal University, Guilin, China"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Training", "Automata", "Computational modeling", "Systems simulation", "Observers", "Learning automata", "Discrete-event systems"], "Author Keywords": ["Discrete event system", "current-state opacity", "supervisory control theory", "reinforcement learning"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f474a15", "Title": "Enhancing Bug-Inducing Commit Identification: A Fine-Grained Semantic Analysis Approach", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10711218/", "Abstract": "The SZZ algorithm and its variants have been extensively utilized for identifying bug-inducing commits based on bug-fixing commits.

When a drone claims that there is an untrustworthy action, such as compromised or incorrect data transmission against the IIoCV, the cloud authenticates the claims by inspecting the blockchain. It penalizes the compromised IIoCV if the claim is correct. Otherwise, the cloud can punish the drone itself (e.g., by reducing the trustworthiness score). As a result, bTrust enhances cross-regional data exchange trustworthiness using the blockchain that depends on a reduced trust assumption.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/MNET.2024.3399751", "Date of Publication": "13 May 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Network"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "0890-8044", "Electronic ISSN": "1558-156X"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Tao Hai", "labs": ["School of Computer and Information, Qiannan Normal University for Nationalities, and Artificial Intelligence Research Center (AIRC), Duyun, Guizhou, China"]}, {"name": "Zakirul Alam Bhuiyan", "labs": ["School of Computer and Information, Qiannan Normal University for Nationalities, and Artificial Intelligence Research Center (AIRC), Duyun, Guizhou, China"]}, {"name": "Mohamed Rahouti", "labs": ["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Fordham University, NY, USA"]}, {"name": "Jincheng Zhou", "labs": ["School of Computer and Information, Qiannan Normal University for Nationalities, and Key Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligent Optimization of Guizhou Province, Duyun, Guizhou, China"]}, {"name": "Jian Shen", "labs": ["School of Information Science and Engineering Hangzhou, Zhejiang Sci-Tech University, Zhejiang, China"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Drones", "Internet of Things", "Cloud computing", "Blockchains", "Smart grids", "Servers", "Monitoring"], "Author Keywords": []}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f474a1a", "Title": "Adaptive Migration Method for Virtual Network Functionality in Cloud and Blockchain Based Integrated Environment for Handling Socio-Economic Systems", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10556734/", "Abstract": "As Blockchain and Cloud computing are becoming more prevalent, the ability to adapt and maintain stability in virtual networks becomes increasingly important for socio-economic systems. The dynamic nature of VNF (virtual network functionality), which can be moved, replicated, or deleted based on network demands, requires efficient and effective algorithms for VNF adaptation and smoother functionality of socio-economic systems. Based on this, the study proposes the Migration Cost and Network Energy Consumption (MJOVME) algorithm for virtual network function adaptation based on bandwidth and other required resources, and proves its effectiveness. The experimental results reveal that the weighting factor value lies between 0.12 and 0.22 whereas the network energy loss shows diminishing trend under different bandwidths, while the migration cost loss is exhibiting an upward trend. The integration of VNF with Cloud and Blockchain environments leads to enhanced security, data integrity, scalability, and decentralized distributed management for socio-economic systems. As the number of SFC (service function chain) requests increases, the network energy loss of the MJOVME algorithm lies within 200 1200 migration cost as compared with the algorithm considered for comparative study which is approximately 0.2W104W higher than MJOVME. The MJOVME algorithm has attained an average resource utilization rate of 69.50% and a memory resource utilization rate of 66.78% which is commendable in integrated environment. The standard deviation of computing resources is 12.41% and the standard deviation of memory resources is 15.08%, lower than the comparative method.

To enhance the robustness of subgroup multisignatures, we utilize an on-chain smart contract instead of an off-chain combiner to check each individual signature. We propose a blockchain-assisted robust subgroup ECDSA multisignature scheme and prove its robustness and unforgeability. Since the ECDSA signature is the most popular signature used for blockchains and some blockchain platforms, such as Ethereum, already have a precompiled contract for the verification of the ECDSA, the on-chain costs for each single ECDSA signature are very low. Experiments show that our blockchain-assisted subgroup ECDSA multisignature has efficient on-chain costs. On the other hand, multiplicative-to-additive (MtA) protocols are used in the construction of subgroup multisignatures, which results in increased communication and computational costs.

The issue with sharding is the enormous volume of cross-shard transactions, which results in high communication costs to ensure transaction atomicity. The account-based sharding problem can be viewed as the vertex classification problem of the account-transaction graph. However, prior studies employed traditional graph partitioning algorithms for sharding, failing to make full use of the account relationship in the graph structure. In this work, we aim to address the sharding problem from the perspective of deep learning that can learn the graph structure toward sustainable communications. We propose an efficient deep learning-based sharding scheme (DLS) based on the graph attention (GAT) network. The account and transaction information are input into the GAT for semi-supervised training and account/vertex classification. Since the performance may degrade in the case of limited label information, we incorporate the label propagation method to acquire the label information of non-trained accounts. We also extend our approach to deal with the new account scenario without retraining the neural network.

The existing security schemes of V2G mostly consider the threat of external attacks and conduct defense strategies such as identity authentication and key management, which cannot resist internal attacks initiated by selfish or captured terminals that have passed authentication. In this paper, we propose a lightweight blockchain-based trust management method for V2G terminals. Specifically, we provide a blockchain-based V2G trust management architecture. A V2G terminal adaptive trust calculation model based on information entropy is established, which provides a basis for accurate trust calculation.

Wherein five consensus guidelines ensure that only real trust parameters can be written on the chain. In this way, malicious terminals can be identified by consensus screening and trust calculation, thereby taking control measures.

They allow proving a particular value of an entry in the state to a node that maintains only the root of the Merkle trees, a hash-based signature computed over the data in a hierarchical manner. Verification of particular state entries is crucial in reaching a consensus on the execution of a block where state information is required in the processing of its transactions. For instance, a payment transaction should be based on the balance of the two involved accounts. The proof length affects the network communication and is typically logarithmic in the state size. In this paper, we take advantage of typical transaction characteristics for better organizing Merkle trees to improve blockchain network performance. We focus on the common transaction processing where Merkle proofs are jointly provided for multiple accounts. We first provide lower bounds for the communication cost that are based on the distribution of accounts involved in the transactions. We then describe algorithms that consider traffic patterns for significantly reducing it. The algorithms are inspired by various coding methods such as Huffman coding, partition and weight balancing. We also generalize our approach towards the encoding of smart contract transactions that involve an arbitrary number of accounts.

However, as UAVs communicate over insecure open wireless channels, the security challenges and privacy concerns are becoming increasingly prominent. Moreover, some existing schemes to achieve authentication and key agreement among UAVs are spliced with the assistance of two UAV-2-GCS mechanisms, which are not flexible enough to be applied in the Internet of Drones (IoD) scenarios. This paper proposes a Blockchain-assisted authentication and key agreement scheme for UAVs networks referred to as BAKAS-UAV, which addresses security and privacy concerns and overcomes high computational and communication costs in the IoD. A blockchain-based network model is presented in which the ground station acts as an edge node and manages the blockchain, which assists authentication and key agreement. Based on the network model, both types of authentication and key agreement mechanisms, UAV-2-GCS and UAV-2-UAV, are proposed, respectively. In particular, the ground control station (GCS) does not participate in the authentication and key agreement of UAV-2-UAV process; only upon the process is completed the two UAVs synchronize the updated information with GCS. We also implement a smart contract as the authentication service, and the experimental implementation demonstrates the availability of our scheme in IoD. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) is introduced on the UAVs side to defend against physical capture attacks and also to implement authentication and key agreement mechanisms. The semantic security is proved formally based on the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model, and the informal analysis shows that the scheme satisfies the demanded security requirements.

In a dynamic wireless network, drones often share data with multiple users, which is vulnerable to various security threats, e.g., eavesdropping, privacy leakage, and impersonation. Ensuring secure sharing of drone operation data is a critical issue. Existing schemes employ blockchain to ensure accountability in untrusted IoD contexts. However, drones perform excessive operations, e.g., consensus and homomorphic encryption, leading to impractical drone computation overhead. Furthermore, these existing schemes perform point-to-multipoint (P2MP) data sharing by using identity-based broadcast encryption (IBBE) as it has stateless receiver property, i.e., drones can directly establish sharing groups based on the receiver identities. However, these IBBE-based schemes need to preset the sharing group capacity, reducing sharing efficiency and flexibility in dynamic IoD networks. Also, identities in sharing groups probably result in receiver privacy breaches. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-assisted data-sharing scheme with accountability and privacy-preserving for IoD networks. We utilize on-chain immutable smart contracts and short signatures to construct a lightweight accountability mechanism that can verify and punish the above misbehavior. We develop an efficient privacy-preserving IBBE algorithm for P2MP sharing of drone operation data that enables dynamic group sharing. We prove that our algorithm is secure and receiver anonymity against chosen ciphertext attacks. The experiment results show that our scheme outperforms existing schemes in computational and communication overhead. In real-world logistics scenarios, the wireless data rate of 50 Mbps can satisfy the communication requirements for ciphertext lengths up to 19.5 KB.

This study presents a comprehensive framework comprising 15 dimensions to categorize DAOs based on their operational domain, purpose, scope, voting process, and utilization of crypto-tokens.

Through encrypted blockchain retrieval, data aggregation and outlier detection, a proof-of-distribution consensus algorithm is developed to periodically update a conformal score for each edge user over time. The conformal score measures conformity of one user with patterns of the overall data distribution at current stage and is further utilized as basis for stochastic participant selection and model averaging, which improves stability and pertinence of federated learning in an uncertain environment with heterogeneity and concept drift. In the meantime, based on average learning loss of users with top-ranked conformal scores and engagement of users in the learning process, a reputation score is updated in real time for each user, which offers timely detection of malicious behaviors in the cooperation. The transmission of models and data are both implemented with blockchain, which guarantees privacy preservation and makes the process auditable.

Targeting privacy leakage of cross-device FL in CIoT, various privacy-preserving FL schemes have been proposed. Regrettably, existing schemes still face three significant challenges: 1) Current privacy-preserving strategies struggle to fully defend against Byzantine attacks in FL without compromising data privacy; 2) Most privacy-preserving techniques (e.g. secret sharing) in FL result in substantial computation and communication overhead; 3) The non-colluding dual-server setting limits the applicability of FL. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Byzantine-robust hierarchical federated learning scheme, named BHFL. This scheme not only effectively defends against Byzantine attacks while safeguarding user privacy but also avoids the need for a dual-server architecture. Simultaneously, the hierarchical aggregation structure can effectively train non-IID cross-device data while maintaining high communication efficiency.

These issues stem from the requisite submission of learning model parameters by multiple clients to FDL\u2019s global model. To surmount these challenges, the innovative Swarm Learning (SL) paradigm emerges as a solution, presenting a modular approach that fuses distributed computing with blockchain-based coordination. This amalgamation eliminates the dependence on a centralized infrastructure. This study introduces an avant-garde Swarm-Federated Deep Learning framework (SHAR-SFDL) that seamlessly incorporates SL into the FDL framework. SHAR-SFDL orchestrates the collaboration of smartphone users in creating local SL models through blockchain-enabled synergy. The aggregation of these local models into a global FDL model across diverse SL groups is achieved through a groundbreaking method involving model credibility prediction and weight comparison. Notably, the proposed SHAR-SFDL framework showcases a substantial advancement in model performance and a remarkable reduction in edge-to-global communication overhead. Regarding performance evaluation, the proposed model outperformed the other state-of-the-art techniques regarding true and false positive rates across different group densities. Specifically, the TP rates for SHAR-SFDL were 0.891 (High), 0.945 (Medium), and 0.969 (Low), while the corresponding FP rates were 0.035 (High), 0.009 (Medium), and 0.015 (Low).

Traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems rely on centralized Certificate Authorities (CAs) to validate users and manage public keys, but this centralization creates a single point of failure. If a CA is compromised, it can register fake public keys or alter legitimate ones, leading to counterfeit certificates. While blockchain-based approaches decentralize CA authority across multiple entities, these solutions are largely reactive, focusing on certificate issuance and relying on user signatures for validation. They lack a robust mechanism to authenticate and authorize requests before certificate issuance, a crucial step typically managed by Registration Authorities (RA) in CA-based PKI systems. To address this gap, we introduce PKChain, a novel compromise-tolerant and verifiable public key management system built on blockchain. PKChain addresses two key challenges: it uses a Threshold Block Validation (TBV) scheme for key request validation, where validators partially validate requests and collaborate for full validation. Once a request gains majority approval, it advances to the Aggregated Commitment Signature (ACS) scheme, where validators collectively issue certificates. By requiring majority approval in the TBV stage before moving to certificate issuance, PKChain ensures proactive security throughout the process. To achieve consensus on validation and issuance, we propose a threshold cryptography-based consensus mechanism called the practical Byzantine Compromise-tolerant and Verifiable (pBCTV) consensus model, integrating TBV and ACS schemes with the practical Byzantine Fault-tolerance (pBFT) protocol.

However, this collateral substantially inflates the implementation costs, consequently leading to higher service fees for users. Furthermore, most watchtowers are typically operated by a third-party entity, creating a single point of failure. To ameliorate the status quo, we propose a novel approach where PCN nodes collaboratively implement a watchtower system named \u201cSilenTower.\u201d Our proposal is rooted in the fundamental principles of blockchain systems, emphasizing maintenance by a community with an honest majority.

To tackle these concerns, we propose a novel approach to constructing efficient and flexible voting protocols that concurrently ensure fairness and anonymity. Specifically, we encapsulate the decryption private keys corresponding to the public keys of encrypted ballots in time capsules to safeguard voting fairness. Additionally, based on our proposed approach, we construct an efficient and flexible score voting protocol for smart cities. The protocol employs traceable ring signature to protect the voter anonymity and public traceability, utilizes a dual-key additive homomorphic ElGamal encryption to encapsulate ballots.

To address these challenges, a novel solution called LandChain is proposed in this article. The LandChain utilizes MultiChain, consisting of MainChain and SideChain, to securely transfer LRs among users, such as buyers, sellers, land donors, and owners. The LandChain incorporates innovative algorithms like record forwarder selection (RFS), trust establishment (TE), and record transfer and confirmation (RTC). Furthermore, LandChain verifies the legitimacy of users before transferring LRs through the verify user legitimacy algorithm. Security analysis shows LandChain is secure from double-spending, liveness, Sybil, replay, and man-in-the-middle attacks. The implementation of LandChain is developed and tested on the docker engine platform. According to performance analysis, the LandChain reduces record confirmation latency by 18% (MultiChain) and 50% (Blockchain).

It is primarily utilized in anonymous cryptocurrencies such as Monero. In recent years, to counter the security threats posed by quantum computing to classical RingCT (C-RCT), several post-quantum RingCT (P-RCT) protocols were proposed. However, prior studies do not address the account transition from C-RCT to P-RCT, which is essential to ensure the quantum resistance and usability of user accounts following the upgrade from C-RCT to P-RCT. In this paper, we introduce a RingCT account transition protocol (RAT), which allows users to migrate their accounts from the blockchain with C-RCT to that with P-RCT. The protocol consists of two cryptographic components: a zero-knowledge proof scheme used to prove that two group generators correspond to the same witness, and a cross-cryptosystems commitment transition protocol. RAT is fully decentralized and does not require any trusted third parties. Additionally, the transition process does not disclose the account balance and maintains both atomicity and consistency.

To address these issues, we present in this survey a novel multi-layered pipeline ecosystem composed of (1) the Metaverse computing, networking, communications and hardware infrastructure, (2) environment digitization, and (3) user interactions. For every layer, we discuss the components that detail the steps of its development. Also, for each of these components, we examine the impact of a set of enabling technologies and empowering domains (e.g., Artificial Intelligence, Security & Privacy, Blockchain, Business, Ethics, and Social) on its advancement. In addition, we explain the importance of these technologies to support decentralization, interoperability, user experiences, interactions, and monetization. Our presented study highlights the existing challenges for each component, followed by research directions and potential solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the most comprehensive and allows users, scholars, and entrepreneurs to get an in-depth understanding of the Metaverse ecosystem to find their opportunities and potentials for contribution.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/COMST.2024.3392642", "Date of Publication": "23 April 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials"}, "issn_info": {"Electronic ISSN": "1553-877X"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "H.

However, with the increase of privacy threats and malicious activities, three major challenges are emerging: securing privacy, alleviating straggler problems, and mitigating Byzantine attacks. Although recent studies explore coded computing for privacy and straggler problems, as well as Byzantine-robust aggregation for poisoning attacks, they are not well-designed against both threats simultaneously. To tackle these obstacles and achieve an efficient Byzantine-robust and straggler-resilient distributed learning framework, in this article, we present Byzantine-robust and cost-effective distributed machine learning (BCML), a codesign of coded computing and Byzantine-robust aggregation. To balance the Byzantine resilience and efficiency, we design a cosine-similarity-based Byzantine-robust aggregation method tailored for coded computing to filter out malicious gradients efficiently in real time. Furthermore, trust scores derived from similarity are published to the blockchain for the reliability and traceability of social users. Experimental results show that our BCML can tolerate Byzantine attacks without compromising convergence accuracy with lower time consumption, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, it is 6x faster than the uncoded approach and 2x faster than the Lagrange coded computing (LCC) approach. Besides, the cosine-similarity-based aggregation method can effectively detect and filter out malicious social users in real time.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TCSS.2024.3361465", "Date of Publication": "07 March 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems"}, "issn_info": {"Electronic ISSN": "2329-924X"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Heyi Zhang", "labs": ["School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"]}, {"name": "Jun Wu", "labs": ["Graduate School of Information, Production and Systems, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"]}, {"name": "Qianqian Pan", "labs": ["School of Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"]}, {"name": "Ali Kashif Bashir", "labs": ["Department of Computing and Mathematics, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, U.K."]}, {"name": "Marwan Omar", "labs": ["Department of Information Technology and Management, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Social networking (online)", "Computational modeling", "Servers", "Encoding", "Data privacy", "Blockchains", "Training"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "Byzantine robust", "coded computing", "distributed learning", "sentiment classification", "social media platform"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f474a4a", "Title": "Towards Auditable and Privacy-Preserving Online Medical Diagnosis Service Over Cloud", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684153/", "Abstract": "While online medical diagnosis provides significant convenience to users, it also incurs the risk of privacy breaches, which inspired the emergence of various privacy-preserving online medical schemes.

Consequently, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving online medical diagnosis scheme based on additive secret sharing (ASS).

However, some artists are opposed to generative art technologies due to the copyright infringement and influence of the artists\u2019 way of earning a living, which makes the artists protest against generative art technologies, causing a lose\u2013lose situation. Adversarial attacks against generative model training are potential solutions to address this issue, while the lose\u2013lose situation cannot be improved. To build a win\u2013win situation, a feasible method is to incentivize the artists to actively contribute their artworks to generative model training without influencing their living or infringing copyright, such as data crowdsourcing, but traditional data crowdsourcing methods cannot well fit the generative art area. Therefore, this article builds a blockchain-based trading system for generative model training data collection and generated artwork circulation. Specifically, this article formulates a social welfare maximization problem based on the reverse auction and designs a corresponding incentive mechanism.

Existing schemes dealing with these problems still suffer from 1) high computational overhead, 2) low model accuracy and poor convergence under privacy-preserving, and 3) poor model robustness when edge nodes fail. Therefore, we propose a novel privacy-preserving model in edge user behavioral analysis termed Safe-FL to protect the behavioral privacy of all edge participants by introducing secure data aggregation and encryption in the federated learning (FL) framework. To reduce the privacy leakage of data uploading in edge user behavior analysis, we first construct a federated learning-based edge user behavior analysis framework. Secondly, we utilize a hybrid encryption scheme to encrypt the local model hierarchically to protect the gradient privacy in edge user behavior analysis and reduce the encryption computation overhead. And finally, to improve the robustness of the model, we propose a decentralized secure gradient aggregation algorithm based on blockchain.

In recent years, several smart contract security incidents have resulted in enormous financial losses. Therefore, it is important to detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts before deployment. Machine learning has been used recently in smart contract vulnerability detection. Unfortunately, due to the loss of information during feature extraction, the detection results are unsatisfactory. Hence, we propose a novel approach called ContractGNN, which combines a new concept of a vulnerability sub-graph (VSG) with graph neural networks (GNNs). Compared with traditional methods, checking a VSG is more accurate because the VSG removes irrelevant vertexes in the control flow graph. Furthermore, a VSG can be aggregated and simplified, thus improving the efficiency of message passing in a GNN. Based on aggregated VSGs, we design a new feature extraction method that preserves semantic information, the order of opcode, and control flows of smart contracts. Moreover, we compare a large number of GNN classification models and select the best one to implement ContractGNN. We then test ContractGNN on 48,493 real-world smart contracts, and the experimental results show that ContractGNN outperforms other smart contract vulnerability detection tools, with an average F1 score of 89.70%.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TNSE.2024.3470788", "Date of Publication": "30 September 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering"}, "issn_info": {"Electronic ISSN": "2327-4697"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Yichen Wang", "labs": ["School of Computer and Control Engineering, Yantai University, Yantai, China"]}, {"name": "Xiangfu Zhao", "labs": ["School of Computer and Control Engineering, Yantai University, Yantai, China"]}, {"name": "Long He", "labs": ["School of Computer and Control Engineering, Yantai University, Yantai, China"]}, {"name": "Zixian Zhen", "labs": ["School of Computer and Control Engineering, Yantai University, Yantai, China"]}, {"name": "Haiyue Chen", "labs": ["School of Computer and Control Engineering, Yantai University, Yantai, China"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Smart contracts", "Feature extraction", "Blockchains", "Open source software", "Graph neural networks", "Cryptocurrency", "Codes", "Security", "Fuzzing", "Accuracy"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "Smart contract", "Vulnerability detection", "Vulnerability sub-graph", "Graph neural network"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f474a57", "Title": "IOTA-Based Game-Theoretic Energy Trading With Privacy-Preservation for V2G Networks", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10551491/", "Abstract": "Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) energy trading based on distributed ledger technologies (DLT), such as blockchains, has attracted much attention due to its promising features, including ease of deployment, decentralization, transparency, and security.

Two participants can use a bidirectional payment channel for making multiple mutual payments without committing them to the blockchain. Opening a payment channel is a slow operation that involves an on-chain transaction locking a certain amount of funds. These aspects limit the number of channels that can be opened or maintained. Users may route payments through a multi-hop path and thus avoid opening and maintaining a channel for each new destination. Unlike regular networks, in PCNs capacity depends on the usage patterns and, moreover, channels may become unidirectional. Since payments often fail due to channel depletion, a protection scheme to overcome failures is of interest. We define the stopping time of a payment channel as the time at which the channel becomes depleted. We analyze the mean stopping time of a channel as well as that of a network with a set of channels and examine the stopping time of channels in particular topologies. We then propose a scheme for optimizing the capacity distribution among the channels in order to increase the minimal stopping time in the network.

Therefore, researchers are paying more attention to this problem and have proposed various methods to detect and eliminate potential reentrancy vulnerabilities before contract deployment. Compared to symbolic execution and pattern-matching methods, fuzz testing method can achieve higher accuracy and are better suitable for detecting cross-contract vulnerabilities. However, existing fuzz testing tools often spend a long time exploring states with little pruning, and most of them adopt the reentrancy vulnerability oracle used by static analysis tools, which ignores whether the vulnerability can be exploited to compromise the access control, mutex, or time locks. To address these issues, we propose EvoFuzzer, an evolutionary fuzzer that focuses on the detection of reentrancy vulnerabilities. EvoFuzzer first leverages static analysis to exclude branches that have no impact on state transitions, then continuously optimizes test case generation using a genetic algorithm that considers both function sequence and parameter assignment, and Meanwhile, EvoFuzzer confirms whether reentrancy vulnerabilities can be exploited by simulating attacks. Our experiments have performed on 198 annotated contracts and 47 honeypot contracts, and experimental results show that EvoFuzzer can detect 91.7% of reentrancy vulnerabilities with no false positives, achieve the highest F1 score with 95.7%, which is 5.9% higher than the next best approach (Confuzzius), and we also find that it reduces more than 10% of branches when EvoFuzzer adopts a pruning strategy.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TNSE.2024.3447025", "Date of Publication": "21 August 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering"}, "issn_info": {"Electronic ISSN": "2327-4697"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Bixin Li", "labs": ["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"]}, {"name": "Zhenyu Pan", "labs": ["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"]}, {"name": "Tianyuan Hu", "labs": ["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Smart contracts", "Blockchains", "Open source software", "Fuzzing", "Cryptocurrency", "Codes", "Source coding"], "Author Keywords": ["blockchain", "smart contract", "reentrancy", "fuzz testing"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f474a5f", "Title": "A Poisson Game-based Incentive Mechanism for Federated Learning in Web 3.0", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654509/", "Abstract": "As the next generation of the internet, Web 3.0 is expected to revolutionize the Internet and enable users to have greater control over their data and privacy.

To deter such misbehavior, it is essential to establish a mechanism for verifying the ownership of the model and as well tracing its origin to the leaker among the FL participants. In this paper, we present FedTracker, the first FL model protection framework that provides both ownership verification and traceability. FedTracker adopts a bi-level protection scheme consisting of global watermark mechanism and local fingerprint mechanism. The former authenticates the ownership of the global model, while the latter identifies which client the model is derived from. FedTracker leverages Continual Learning (CL) principles to embed the watermark in a way that preserves the utility of the FL model on both primitive task and watermark task. FedTracker also devises a novel metric to better discriminate different fingerprints. Experimental results show FedTracker is effective in ownership verification, traceability, and maintains good fidelity and robustness against various watermark removal attacks.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TDSC.2024.3390761", "Date of Publication": "18 April 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "1545-5971", "Electronic ISSN": "1941-0018"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Shuo Shao", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, Zhejiang University, China"]}, {"name": "Wenyuan Yang", "labs": ["School of Cyber Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, China"]}, {"name": "Hanlin Gu", "labs": ["Webank AI Lab, China"]}, {"name": "Zhan Qin", "labs": ["State Key Laboratory of Blockchain and Data Security, Zhejiang University, China"]}, {"name": "Lixin Fan", "labs": ["Webank AI Lab, China"]}, {"name": "Qiang Yang", "labs": ["Computer Science and Engineering Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Watermarking", "Fingerprint recognition", "Servers", "Computational modeling", "Task analysis", "Protection", "Data models"], "Author Keywords": ["Federated learning", "model watermark", "ownership verification", "traceability"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f474a62", "Title": "TiFedCrowd: Federated Crowdsourcing With Time-Controlled Incentive", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596958/", "Abstract": "Crowdsourcing provides an effective way to collect labeled data and train models for machine learning. However, crowd workers performing data collection may expose them to the risk of privacy breaches, which lowers their willingness to participate in the tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel incentive mechanism for a federated learning paradigm, namely TiFedCrowd, which mitigates the risk of privacy breaches for crowd workers and obtains high-quality crowdsourcing data and learning models at the minimum cost. TiFedCrowd allows clients to keep privacy-related data locally, just needing to upload trained models (parameters) to the server. The server then aggregates local models into a global model. TiFedCrowd models the federated crowdsourcing process as a two-stage Stackelberg game and motivates more workers to complete tasks with high quality and efficiency. It also provides a time control mechanism to manage the quality of the submitted outcomes, the range of data freshness, and the waiting time. TiFedCrowd requires the client to complete the federated crowdsourcing task within a specified time interval while globally maximizing the utility of both clients and the server by solving the Nash equilibrium. We also extended TiFedCrowd to the multiple heterogeneous federated crowdsourcing scenario. Extensive simulation shows that TiFedCrowd not only ensures the fairness of the incentive but also has significant effects on accelerating convergence speed, selecting data/model quality, and saving the budget. Moreover, we also confirm the effectiveness of TiFedCrowd in real-world crowdsourcing tasks.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TETCI.2024.3423346", "Date of Publication": "12 July 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence"}, "issn_info": {"Electronic ISSN": "2471-285X"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Xiaoqian Jiang", "labs": ["School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"]}, {"name": "Jing Zhang", "labs": ["School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"]}, {"name": "Ming Wu", "labs": ["School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"]}, {"name": "Victor S.

However, all these mechanisms have to change either the training or inference process, which might be out of reach of the defenders, especially when the models are deployed in a third-party cloud service.

As people begin to reevaluate traditional notions of monetary ownership, cryptocurrencies will be poised to play an even more critical role in the future. However, the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies has been hampered by several challenges, including volatility and scalability. The concepts of Stablecoin and Payment Channel Network (PCN) are promising proposals for these problems, providing effective individual solutions. While PCN addresses the scalability issue of cryptocurrencies, its transaction reliability is not always up to par for widespread use. Similarly, the increasing centralisation of Stablecoins contradicts the fundamental principle of introducing cryptocurrencies. This paper introduces a decentralised model that integrates both approaches to establish a monetary system while mitigating their inherent drawbacks. It encompasses a subsidised node and stablecoin designs for PCN with a dedicated and incentivised layer of entities to facilitate reliable PCN transactions and contribute to stabilising the underlying currency of PCN. It introduces an integrated network-backed stablecoin for PCN, achieving both stability and scalability concurrently. Also, approximately half of the initial funding required to establish payment channels is derived from external sources, ensuring a guaranteed return on investment within an under-collateralised and decentralised environment. Our system has been substantiated through game theory and simulations, demonstrating its capacity to stabilise the coin's value and effectively fulfil the expected functionalities of a currency. Empirical tests have confirmed its retention of PCN's scalability, even with additional steps integrated to implement the proposed protocol. We also highlight its resilience to potential attacks. Our solution will improve transaction reliability, collateralisation, and underlying coin stability, making cryptocurrencies more suitable for widespread adoption.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3477258", "Date of Publication": "09 October 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Access"}, "issn_info": {"Electronic ISSN": "2169-3536"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Anupa De Silva", "labs": ["Data Science Institute, University of Galway, University Rd, Galway, Ireland"]}, {"name": "Subhasis Thakur", "labs": ["Data Science Institute, University of Galway, University Rd, Galway, Ireland"]}, {"name": "John Breslin", "labs": ["Data Science Institute, University of Galway, University Rd, Galway, Ireland"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Scalability", "Smart contracts", "Peer-to-peer computing", "Blockchains", "Sharding", "Investment", "Bitcoin", "Stability criteria", "Reliability theory", "Reliability engineering", "Game theory", "Cryptocurrency"], "Author Keywords": ["Blockchain", "Cryptocurrency", "Game Theory", "Payment Channel Network", "Reliability", "Stablecoin", "Scalability"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f474a68", "Title": "Data Aggregation Management With Self-Sovereign Identity in Decentralized Networks", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659216/", "Abstract": "Data aggregation management is paramount in data-driven distributed systems.

Therefore, this paper presents Format Pareto Preserving Distributed Encryption Standard (FPPDES) and Adjustable Trainable Sigmoid Nesterov-accelerated Recurrent Neural Networ (ATSNRNN) - enabled privacy preserved secure cooperative SS in CRN. Initially, the primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) are registered in the blockchain. Here, the Elliptic Curve Iterated Summed Cryptography (ECISC) is employed to generate the keys. Afterward, for SUs, the Fusion Center (FC) is selected by using GaussIT Skilled Optimization Algorithm (GIT-SOA) and stored in the blockchain. At this point, FC details are hashed by using Secure Lagrange Multiplied Hash Algorithm-256 (SLMHA-256). Then, spectrum sensing is performed by feature extraction, spatiotemporal evaluation, and spectrum sensing via ATSNRNN. Next, the sensing results are encrypted by using FPPDES. Afterward, the encrypted outcome is transmitted to the FC by authenticating the FC. If FC authentication verification is passed, then the encrypted information is fed to FC; otherwise, FC is reselected and updated in the blockchain. Subsequently, by using SLMHA-256, the location matching for PU and SU is done. If the location is matched, then spectrum allocation for SU is done by using GIT-SOA; otherwise, the allocation is declined.

First, the traceability and tamper-proof of blockchain are used to realize the secure transaction of IoMT data, transforming the secure transaction of IoMT data into a two-stage Stackelberg game. The dual-chain architecture is used to ensure the security and privacy protection of the transaction. The main-chain manages regular IoMT data transactions, while the side-chain deals with data trading activities aimed at resale. Simultaneously, the perceptual hash technology is used to realize data rights confirmation, which maximally protects the rights and interests of each participant in the transaction.

However, a malicious aggregator, in reality, could abandon and replace the client's training models, or insert fake clients, to manipulate the final training results. In this work, we introduce zkFL , which leverages zero-knowledge proofs to tackle the issue of a malicious aggregator during the training model aggregation process. To guarantee the correct aggregation results, the aggregator provides a proof per round, demonstrating to the clients that the aggregator executes the intended behavior faithfully. To further reduce the verification cost of clients, we use blockchain to handle the proof in a zero-knowledge way, where miners ( i.e. , the participants validating and maintaining the blockchain data) can verify the proof without knowing the clients' local and aggregated models.

However, the vast number of transactions on the platform has also brought a number of illegal activities, such as phishing scams, which have caused significant damage to the Ethereum ecosystem. Due to anonymity of the blockchain, it is difficult for detectors to extract features that can be directly applied to phishing scams detection. Existing studies mainly model Ethereum transaction records as a network and mine key information from them to identify phishing addresses. However, these methods usually employ traditional feature engineering or network embedding, ignoring the fine-grained features in the transaction network. In addition, since the original network is too large to make learning difficult, existing work usually uses random walk to sample a part of nodes for training, thus ignoring the multiplicity of the network. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a three-stream feature fusion (TSFF) approach to enhance the feature representation of nodes. Specifically, we construct node states to guide random walk sampling, and manually extracted 8-dimensional features from the resulting dataset as basic features. Temporal features are jointly learned through long short-term memory network and Contrastive Learning. We combine residual blocks and Graph Convolutional Network to extract fine-grained structural features from transactional networks. Finally, we fuse these three types of features and input them into a downstream classifier.

By optimizing the lighting control system with the aid of the hybrid PSO (IHPSO), the intelligent PID control algorithm shows improvements in controlling the lighting system in an automated manner. The system has been compared with the exiting methods for proving its performance over the existing techniques. Performance test experiments demonstrate that the IHPSO fuzzy PID control algorithm exhibits a smaller error speed compared to traditional methods. The effectiveness of the algorithm is evaluated using 100 units of samples, resulting in a higher accuracy rate ranging from 87% to 99%, with an average accuracy rate of 94% across the 100 residential units. The improved PSO algorithm is further assessed by repeatedly testing the same samples, showing significant superiority over other algorithms with a Mean Relative Error (MRE) of 2.357%, Mean Square Error (MSE) of 1.372%, and accuracy of 94%. These findings reveal that the proposed IHPSO fuzzy PID control mechanism is achieving high accuracy in saving the consumption of energy in lighting control system for consumers of electricity.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TCE.2024.3436686", "Date of Publication": "06 August 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "0098-3063", "Electronic ISSN": "1558-4127"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Wei Cheng", "labs": ["College of Artificial Intelligence, Chongqing Business Vocational College, Chongqing, China"]}, {"name": "Jianmei Zeng", "labs": ["College of Artificial Intelligence, Chongqing Business Vocational College, Chongqing, China"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Control systems", "Accuracy", "Lighting control", "PI control", "PD control", "Lighting", "Motors"], "Author Keywords": ["Fuzzy PID", "Consumer Electronics", "Hybrid PSO", "Lighting control system", "Machine Intelligence"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f474a7a", "Title": "Leveraging Consumer Technology for Healthcare Systems Using Blockchain Based Bio-Sensor Devices", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587030/", "Abstract": "Wireless biosensor devices have significantly enhanced level of convenience associated with patient treatment. Presently, most uncertified aggregate signature methods struggle to withstand key attacks that employ only specific keys. This paper presents an uncertified parallel key-isolated aggregate signature framework that utilizes blockchain technology in wireless medical sensor networks and biosensor devices for consumer electronics to tackle the challenges. The proximity of the signature verification and aggregation processes to end users is increased by integrating a bio-sensor device for consumer electronics into the cutting-edge framework. This action simultaneously enhances the safeguarding of patient confidentiality and mitigates computational burden on primary cloud server.

To support CAS applications such as AI-driven decision-making and blockchain-based smart data management platform, data and message exchange/dissemination is a fundamental element. The distributed message broadcast and forward protocols in CAS, such as vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), can suffer from significant message loss and uncertain transmission delay, and faulty nodes might disseminate fake messages to confuse the network. Therefore, the consensus mechanism is essential in CAS with distributed structure to guaranteed correct nodes agree on the same parameter and reach consistency. However, due to the wireless nature of CAS, traditional consensus cannot be directly deployed. In addition, with the development of intelligence in machines, traditional consensus might be inefficient for future CAS. This article reviews several existing consensus mechanisms, including average/maximum/minimum estimation consensus mechanisms that apply on quantity, Byzantine fault tolerance consensus for request, state machine replication (SMR) and blockchain, as well as their implementations in CAS. To deploy wireless-adapted consensus, we propose a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based message structure to build a non-equivocation data dissemination protocol for CAS, which has resilience against message loss and unpredictable forwarding latency, and has the potential to solve the first step of future intelligent consensus.

Conventional authentication schemes are no longer suitable for 6G-enabled IoV due to high latency, single point of failure, and heavy management costs. Additionally, existing literature on multi-domain authentication mainly investigates vehicle mobility, ignoring the challenges posed by vehicle heterogeneity.

To safeguard the privacy of participants, decentralized anonymous payment (DAP) systems such as ZCash and Zether have emerged. These systems employ cryptographic techniques to conceal the trader addresses and payment amounts. However, this anonymity presents challenges in terms of regulation. To address this issue, we propose the Walsh-DAP (WDAP) scheme, an efficient and generic regulation scheme for decentralized anonymous payments that strikes a balance between regulation and privacy preservation. Our scheme introduces two regulation policies: first, users who have exceeded their spending limits within a certain period will be identified during the regulation process; second, the supervisor possesses the capability to trace any anonymous transaction. To implement regulation effectively, we have designed an innovative commitment scheme, Walsh commitment, which leverages the orthogonal properties of Walsh codes to achieve the features of aggregatability and extractability. The supervisor in WDAP only needs to deal with the aggregation result of the Walsh commitments instead of the huge amount of raw transactions information, which greatly increases the efficiency. In a DAP system with 256 users, 10 transactions per second and 30 days as a regulation period, we reduced the communication cost for regulation from 14GB to 94.20KB, and the computing cost from \\text{1.6}\\times \\text{10}^{\\text{5}}\ns to 2.17s.

Existing KA schemes employ relation authentication labels to conduct targeted audits with keywords, which significantly improves the cost-effectiveness. However, such schemes typically support only a single-challenge scenario, which may not always be practical. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a hierarchical challenge mechanism grounded in user attributes. This mechanism leverages inequality and affiliation relationships to comply with a predefined tree structure for access policies. Incorporated during the challenge-response phase of the auditing model, it permits users to initiate cross-challenges. Expanding upon this hierarchical mechanism, we propose an attribute-based hierarchical keyword auditing scheme, abbreviated as {\\mathcal{AHKA}}\nx . {\\mathcal{AHKA}}\nx combines searchable encryption to conduct cross-targeted audits and benefits from the hash collision mapping of Bloom filters to safeguard against keyword guessing attacks. Moreover, we design a fault localization algorithm based on a variant of the binary search technique. It locates in batch the faulty cloud servers and damaged data blocks after an audit failure. As an integral part of {\\mathcal{AHKA}}\nx , the algorithm significantly enhances our scheme's practicability.

In such a system, both efficient matching of users with available vehicles and optimal pricing mechanisms play crucial roles in maximizing system revenue. However, most existing schemes utilize user-to-vehicle (two-sided) matching and pricing, which are unrealistic for DVSS due to the lack of participation of service providers. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel Three-sided stable Matching with an optimal Pricing (TRIMP) scheme. First, to achieve maximum utilities for all three parties simultaneously, we formulate the optimal policy and pricing problem as a three-stage Stackelberg game and derive its equilibrium points accordingly. Second, relying on these solutions from the Stackelberg game, we construct a three-sided cyclic matching for DVSS. Third, as the existence of such a matching is NP-complete, we design a specific vehicle sharing algorithm to realize stable matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our TRIMP scheme, which optimizes the matching process and ensures efficient resource allocation, leading to a more stable and well-functioning decentralized vehicle sharing ecosystem.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TMC.2024.3475481", "Date of Publication": "07 October 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "1536-1233", "Electronic ISSN": "1558-0660"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Yang Xu", "labs": ["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"]}, {"name": "Shanshan Zhang", "labs": ["School of Computer Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"]}, {"name": "Chen Lyu", "labs": ["MoE Key Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Research of Computation and Economics, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai, China"]}, {"name": "Jia Liu", "labs": ["Center for Strategic Cyber Resilience Research and Development, National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan"]}, {"name": "Tarik Taleb", "labs": ["Ruhr University Bochum, Bochum, Germany"]}, {"name": "Shiratori Norio", "labs": ["Research and Development Initiative, Chuo University, Tokyo, Japan"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Pricing", "Vehicle dynamics", "Games", "Stability analysis", "Numerical stability", "Heuristic algorithms", "Mobile computing", "Costs", "Blockchains", "Security"], "Author Keywords": ["Distributed vehicle sharing", "pricing", "three-sided stable matching", "Stackelberg game"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f474a87", "Title": "Experimental Studies of Metaverse Streaming", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430223/", "Abstract": "Metaverse aims to construct a large, unified, immersive, and shared digital realm by combining various technologies, namely XR (extended reality), blockchain, and digital twin, among others.

Power generation companies can form a union to share the total carbon emission quotas to maximize their total profit. We show the optimality of the grand coalition by proving that the profit function is superadditive. This result highlights the benefits of cooperation. Besides, we propose a profit allocation mechanism that allocates the total profit to different power generation companies. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed profit allocation mechanism is in the core of the coalitional game such that no group of power generation companies has any incentives to leave the grand coalition.

However, challenges such as unpredictable wireless conditions, resource constraints, and task redundancy have intertwined impacts on the overall performance of edge video streaming systems (EVS). Therefore, it is essential to have an integrated framework that addresses resource management, computational offloading, and video task preprocessing. Existing optimization strategies often neglect the simultaneous management of computational offloading, resource allocation, and video task preprocessing, leading to a suboptimal system utility. Moreover, they struggle to handle high-dimensional decision variables. On the other hand, learning-based adaptive schemes fall short in integrating distributed decisions and ensuring the scalability of wireless devices. Additionally, current approaches lack adaptive incentives. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel framework called AIRA, which is based on improved multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and smart contracts. AIRA manages resources, video compression, and adaptive incentives in a distributed manner. It consists of a MARL-driven cooperative learning algorithm (CLA) and a smart contract-guided adaptive incentive mechanism. Leveraging an actorcritic structure, the CLA enables wireless devices to master strategies for resource allocation, video task compression, and offloading, utilizing historical data. Notably, the CLA incorporates an attention mechanism to select pivotal tuples from the observationaction pairings among different agents, ensuring improved scalability and computational prowess. Evaluations based on real-world trajectories demonstrate that AIRA enables adaptive incentives.

Existing phishing scam detection methods typically model public transaction records on the blockchain as a graph, and then identify phishing addresses through manual feature extraction or graph learning frameworks. Meanwhile, these methods model transactions within a period as a static network for analysis. Therefore, these methods lack the ability to capture fine-grained time dynamics, and on the other hand, they cannot handle the large-scale and continuously growing transaction data on the Ethereum blockchain, resulting in lower scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a two-dimensional streaming framework 2DynEthNet for Ethereum phishing scam detection. First , we cast the transaction series into 6 slices according to block numbers, treating each as a separate task. In the first dimension , we treat transaction features as edge features instead of node features within one task, allowing each transaction to be streamed in 2DynEthNet, aiming to capture the evolutionary features of the Ethereum transaction network at a fine-grained level in continuous time. In the second dimension , we adopt the strategy of incremental information training between tasks, which utilizes meta-learning to quickly update the model parameters under new slices, thus effectively improving the scalability of the model. Finally , experimental results on large-scale real Ethereum phishing scam datasets show that our 2DynEthNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with 28.44% average Recall and achieves the most efficient training speed, proving the effectiveness of both temporal edge representation and meta-learning.

Using a different access control (\u03b2), this system efficiently fixes corrupted electronic circuits by blocking illegal access and restoring normal control using IoT records. The complex procedure requirements and control flow are carefully observed and guided by dual-layer neural networks.

This problem prevents conducting reliable performance assessments on the analysis tools. An effective way to solve this problem is to inject anomalies into real-world contracts and automatically label the locations and types of the injected anomalies. SolidiFI , as the first and only tool in this area, was developed to automatically inject anomalies into Ethereum smart contracts. However, SolidiFI is subject to the limitations from its methodologies (e.g., its injection accuracy and authenticity are low). To address these limitations, we propose an approach called SCAnoGenerator . SCAnoGenerator supports Solidity 0.5.x, 0.6.x, 0.7.x and enables automatic anomaly injection for Ethereum smart contracts via analyzing the contracts\u2019 control and data flows. Based on this approach, we develop an open-source tool, which can inject 20 types of anomalies into smart contracts.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-layer privacy-aware trust evaluation CIDS framework, termed 2PT-CIDS, tailored to VANET. In 2PT-CIDS, vehicles and roadside units (RSUs) cooperate efficiently to enhance anomalous vehicle detection and notification. Considering its potential privacy leakage, we then present two types of game-theoretic information incentive mechanisms. In the case of traffic congestion, the privacy-aware incentive mechanism is presented based on the Stackelberg game. A Barycentric Lagrange interpolation (BLI) based algorithm is then proposed to speedy achieve the Nash equilibrium (NE). In the case of traffic smooth, the varying high velocities of vehicles are involved and a noncooperative game-based mechanism is proposed. The optimal NE decision selection is reconstructed as a Markov decision process (MDP) and the NE point is obtained via the designed novel reward-shaping double duelling deep Q network (D3QN) learning algorithm.

The internet of vehicles (IoV) provides a communication platform between vehicles in intercity roads and streets of a city. Various messages such as safety messages and road traffic services can be transferred among objects of the platform including vehicles, Road Side Units (RSU), pedestrians, cloud\u2019s servers and Trusted Authority (TA). To trust the messages and their initiators in IoV, the authentication mechanism is inevitable. On the other hand, vehicles insist on privacy preserving due to their security and safety.

This paper proposes a novel six-step authentication protocol, which is called PPA6-IoV, between vehicles such that the privacy of both initiator vehicle and receipt vehicle is preserved. During the authentication protocol, the session key for secure communication between two vehicles is established. The Crossware ARM simulator along with NS2 simulator is used to evaluate and compare the performance of PPA6-IoV with previous state-of-the-art techniques.

However, existing methods for detecting Ponzi contracts have several limitations. For example, they struggle to deal with the class imbalance problem, and their analysis of function call transactions is inadequate, resulting in redundant features. To tackle the challenges of detecting Ponzi contracts, we present PonziFinder, a novel approach that leverages convolutional-based edge-enhanced graph neural network and attention mechanism for the classification of contract transaction graphs. In contrast to previous methods, we not only consider transaction value and timestamp but also analyze transaction input to standardize and sort transactions. We extract node and edge features that capture the unique characteristics of Ponzi contracts. The edge feature, reflecting interaccount correlation, enhances the propagation and updating of node features for effective Ponzi contract detection. To prevent oversmoothing of node embedding caused by the shallow transaction graph and extract important account node information, we introduce an attention-based global layerwise aggregation mechanism (ALGA) for generating the final contract graph representation for classification. Moreover, we optimize the node feature set and use an effective strategy based on undersampling and ensemble learning to address the issue of class imbalance. Experimental results show that PonziFinder can detect all types of Ponzi contracts (100%) with 97% accuracy when there is sufficient transaction data, outperforming other models. The analysis of input values and the ALGA mechanism are experimentally shown to improve accuracy by 4% and 2%, respectively.

However, the paradigm of P2P faces various challenges ranging from network scalability and reliability to the frequent topology changes of vehicular environments and weak resource management. As a result, a set of problems could be generated, such as data inconsistency and unreliability, weak lookup success rate, and low end-to-end delay, especially when requesting data. To address all these issues, we propose an innovative solution that leverages an aerial backbone consisting of a connected group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This system efficiently covers the integrality of the terrestrial vehicular environment while ensuring efficient data sharing and distribution towards it, thus playing the role of an aerial P2P overlay.

To ensure that these two factors are constantly verified and maintain permanent data availability for the vehicular environment, a Deep Q Network (DQN) method is adopted to optimize the movements of UAVs according to the terrestrial environment dynamics.

In this paper, we construct a Chinese remainder theorem (CRT) empowered certificateless aggregate signcryption scheme with key agreement (CASKA-CRT). As the vehicle joins and leaves dynamically, the proposed scheme can ensure the dynamic security via one modulo division operation.

To ensure successful cooperation, road users must reach a consensus for making collective decisions, while recording vehicular data to analyze and address failures related to such agreements. This data has the potential to provide valuable insights into various vehicular events, while also potentially improving accountability measures. Furthermore, vehicles may benefit from the ability to negotiate and trade services among themselves, adding value to the cooperative driving framework. However, the majority of proposed systems aiming to ensure data security, consensus, or service trading, lack efficient and thoroughly validated mechanisms that consider the distinctive characteristics of vehicular networks. These limitations are amplified by a dependency on the centralized support provided by the infrastructure. Furthermore, corresponding mechanisms must diligently address security concerns, especially regarding potential malicious or misbehaving nodes, while also considering the inherent constraints of the wireless medium. We introduce the Verifiable Event Extension (VEE), an applicational extension designed for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) messages. The VEE operates seamlessly with any existing standardized vehicular communications protocol, addressing crucial aspects of data security, consensus, and trading with minimal overhead. To achieve this, VEE comprises data associated with blockchain techniques, Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) consensus protocols, and cryptocurrency-based mechanics. Using this mechanism, we piggyback new protocols on the existing ITS traffic, minimally impacting the vehicular network. To assess our proposal's feasibility and lightweight nature, we employed a hardware-in-the-loop setup for analysis.

The existing methods for detecting phishing websites rely on the quality of URL feature extraction, and the extraction angle is becoming increasingly rigid. Therefore, this paper proposes a phishing URL detection model that utilizes feature extension. This method uses the TextRank algorithm to generate a feature extension library and embeds the extracted features into the URL to be detected. After the URL is vectorized, it is input into the two-layer classification network proposed in this paper to classify the website. This classifier consists of an upstream task Bert layer and a downstream task CNN layer. It is possible to simultaneously learn the comprehensive representation information and local feature information of URLs, effectively avoiding overfitting problems and improving the ability to identify phishing websites. Comparative experiments are conducted using a dataset of real phishing websites.

The widespread of encryption transmission protocols such as SSL/TLS has led to the dominance of deep learning based approaches. In cybersecurity, strong adversaries often complicate their strategies by constantly developing emerging attacks. Meanwhile, security practitioners desire to grasp the reasons for inference results. However, existing deep learning approaches lack efficient adaptation for incremental traffic types and often have less interpretability. In this paper, we propose I\n2\nRNN, an Incremental and Interpretable Recurrent Neural Network for encrypted traffic classification. The I\n2\nRNN proposes a novel propagation process to extract the sequence fingerprints from sessions with local robustness. Meanwhile, this proposal provides interpretability including time-series feature attribution and inter-class similarity portrait. Moreover, we design I\n2\nRNN in an incremental manner to adapt to emerging traffic types.

To tackle this issue, in this paper, a self-supervised domain adaptation network, which is composed of a backbone network with Siamese architecture and a compression approximation network (ComNet), is proposed for JPEG-resistant image forgery detection and localization. To improve the performance against JPEG compression, ComNet is customized to approximate the JPEG compression operation through self-supervised learning, generating JPEG-agent images with general JPEG compression characteristics.

However, graphs usually suffer from being absent during data collection due to copyright restrictions or privacy-protecting policies. The graph absence could be roughly grouped into attribute-incomplete and attribute-missing cases. Specifically, attribute-incomplete indicates that a portion of the attribute vectors of all nodes are incomplete, while attribute-missing indicates that all attribute vectors of partial nodes are missing. Although various graph imputation methods have been proposed, none of them is custom-designed for a common situation where both types of graph absence exist simultaneously. To fill this gap, we develop a novel graph imputation network termed revisiting initializing then refining (RITR), where both attribute-incomplete and attribute-missing samples are completed under the guidance of a novel initializing-then-refining imputation criterion. Specifically, to complete attribute-incomplete samples, we first initialize the incomplete attributes using Gaussian noise before network learning, and then introduce a structure-attribute consistency constraint to refine incomplete values by approximating a structure-attribute correlation matrix to a high-order structure matrix. To complete attribute-missing samples, we first adopt structure embeddings of attribute-missing samples as the embedding initialization, and then refine these initial values by adaptively aggregating the reliable information of attribute-incomplete samples according to a dynamic affinity structure. To the best of our knowledge, this newly designed method is the first end-to-end unsupervised framework dedicated to handling hybrid-absent graphs.

The existing methods typically either focus solely on single-task forecasting or simply concatenate them through a separate preprocessing imputation procedure for the subsequent classification application. However, these methods often ignore valuable annotated labels or fail to discover meaningful patterns from unlabeled data. Moreover, the approach of separate prefilling may introduce errors due to the noise in raw records, and thus degrade the downstream prediction performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose the time-aware dual attention and memory-augmented network (DAMA) with stochastic generative imputation (SGI). Our model constructs a joint task learning architecture that unifies imputation and classification tasks collaboratively. First, we design a new time-aware DAMA that accounts for irregular sampling rates, inherent data nonalignment, and sparse values in IASS-MTS data. The proposed network integrates both attention and memory to effectively analyze complex interactions within and across IASS-MTS for the classification task. Second, we develop the stochastic generative imputation (SGI) network that uses auxiliary information from sequence data for inferring the time series missing observations.

This paper presents a novel framework for one-shot backdoor removal in federated learning.

In resource-constrained EC environments, overbooking container resources can substantially improve resource utilization. However, existing work overlooks the complex interplay between resource provisioning and container scheduling, which may result in performance degradation or inefficient resource utilization due to highly dynamic resource heterogeneity in EC. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel joint Resource Overbooking and Container Scheduling (ROCS) algorithm. Our approach accounts for resource heterogeneity and the geographical distribution of edge nodes, and we formulate the ROCS problem to consolidate various costs and revenues into a single profit metric for service providers. To enhance resource utilization and maximize the profit of the service providers, we develop an efficient algorithm that operates within a hybrid action space scheme by leveraging soft actor-critic reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a risk assessment mechanism to mitigate overbooking risks. Large-scale simulations with real-world data traces demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed ROCS algorithm, validating its advantage of improving resource utilization within EC networks.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TMC.2024.3386936", "Date of Publication": "10 April 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "1536-1233", "Electronic ISSN": "1558-0660"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Zhiqing Tang", "labs": ["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Future Networks, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, China"]}, {"name": "Fangyi Mou", "labs": ["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Future Networks, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, China"]}, {"name": "Jiong Lou", "labs": ["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"]}, {"name": "Weijia Jia", "labs": ["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Future Networks, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai, China"]}, {"name": "Yuan Wu", "labs": ["State Key Lab of Internet of Things for Smart City, University of Macau, SAR Macau, China"]}, {"name": "Wei Zhao", "labs": ["Shenzhen University of Advanced Technology, Shenzhen, China"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Containers", "Heuristic algorithms", "Resource management", "Task analysis", "Processor scheduling", "Dynamic scheduling", "Edge computing"], "Author Keywords": ["Container scheduling", "edge computing", "resource overbooking", "soft actor-critic reinforcement learning"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f474abd", "Title": "Robust Credit Card Fraud Detection Based on Efficient Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Models", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10731689/", "Abstract": "Credit card fraud detection remains a significant challenge in the financial industry, necessitating advanced models to identify fraudulent activities while minimizing false positives accurately.

Physical layer security (PLS) has received a growing interest from the research community in recent years for its ability to safeguard data confidentiality without relying on key distribution or encryption/decryption, and for its latency advantage over bit-level cryptographic techniques. However, the evolution towards the fifth generation (5G) technology and beyond poses new security challenges that must be addressed in order to fulfill the unprecedented performance requirements of future wireless communication networks. Among the potential key-enabling technologies, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has attracted extensive attention due to its ability to proactively and intelligently reconfigure the wireless propagation environment to combat dynamic wireless channel impairments. Consequently, the RIS technology can be adopted to improve the information-theoretic security of both radio frequency (RF) and optical wireless communications (OWC) systems. It is worth noting that the configuration of RIS in RF communications is different from the one in optical systems at many levels (e.g., RIS materials, signal characteristics, and functionalities). This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the information-theoretic security of RIS-based RF and optical systems. The article first discusses the fundamental concepts of PLS and RIS technologies, followed by their combination in both RF and OWC systems. Subsequently, some optimization techniques are presented in the context of the underlying system model, followed by an assessment of the impact of RIS-assisted PLS through a comprehensive performance analysis. Given that the computational complexity of future communication systems that adopt RIS-assisted PLS is likely to increase rapidly as the number of interactions between the users and infrastructure grows, machine learning (ML) is seen as a promising approach to address this complexity issue while sustaining or improving the network performance. A discussion of recent research studies on RIS-assisted PLS-based systems embedded with ML is presented.

SIM expands the range of attacker\u2019s behaviors by incorporating selfish mining into the traditional framework of innocent and infiltration mining, without increasing the attacker\u2019s computational power.

We determine the attacker\u2019s rewards in one victim pool, multiple victim pools, and the miner\u2019s dilemma within different cases. Subsequently, we examine the impact of an imperfect network environment on the attacker\u2019s rewards within the SIM framework, focusing on the influence of unintentional fork rates on rewards. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that the attacker\u2019s rewards in SIM exceed those in power-adjusting withholding (PAW) by 1.9 \u00d7 and 2.7 \u00d7 in different network environments, respectively.

To this end, we establish the trade problem as a Stackelberg game, and prove the existence of its equilibrium. Another important aspect is that we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to approach the equilibrium in a situation where the instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is unavailable, and the source and relays do not have knowledge of each other\u2019s goal. A multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient-based framework is designed, where the relay alliance and the source act as agents.

We observe that the neighborhood similarity can be utilized to detect point correspondence, and the consistent neighborhood correspondence can be used as a criterion to detect robust overlapping regions. So that a Double-layer Multi-scale Star-graph (DMS) structure is proposed to detect robust correspondences using two different types of multi-scale star-graphs. The first-layer Multi-scale Neighbor Feature Star-graphs (MNFS) takes each point as the center and its multi-scale nearest neighbors as the leaves. The MNFS enables to establish the initial correspondence candidate set between the two point clouds based on multi-scale neighborhood topology and feature similarity. Subsequently, each pair of corresponding points find their nearest neighbors within the correspondence sets to construct a Multi-scale Matching Star-graphs (MMS) on each side, so the mutual correspondence relationships between the MMS vertices are identified. These identified mutual correspondences are treated as vertices to construct the Multi-scale Correspondence Star-graphs (MCS), that indicate the relationships among the correspondences. We design edge weight and vertex weight criterion in MCS to detect only the robust correspondence set that has strong neighborhood consistency, so as to reject the outliers. Finally, the point cloud registration is conducted based on the detected robust correspondence. The experimental results demonstrate clearly that the proposed DMS method exhibits superior robustness when compared to existing state-of-the-art registration algorithms.

The convergence of FL under the imperfect aggregation is analytically validated, where the influence of the local model quantization and modulation is captured through the translation of the SINR thresholds to the symbol error rates (SERs).

Differently from traditional financial scenarios, executing Know Your Customer verification on Ethereum is rather difficult due to its pseudonymous nature. Fortunately, as the transaction records stored in the Ethereum blockchain are publicly accessible, we can understand the behavior of accounts or detect illicit activities via transaction mining. Existing risk control techniques have primarily been developed from the perspectives of de-anonymizing address clustering and illicit account classification. However, these techniques cannot ascertain the potential risks for all accounts and are limited by specific heuristic strategies or insufficient label information. These constraints motivate us to seek an effective rating method for quantifying the spread of risk in a transaction network. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address the problem of account risk rating on Ethereum by proposing a novel model called RiskProp , which includes a de-anonymous score to measure transaction anonymity and a network propagation mechanism to formulate the relationships between accounts and transactions. Experimental results on a realistic Ethereum dataset demonstrate that proposed RiskProp newly discovered 63% of the Top 150 high-risk accounts as suspicious.

However, many state-of-the-art algorithms that require reliable connections can only offer limited throughput in wide-area networks (WANs), where participants are connected over long distances and may experience unpredictable network failures. The partially-connected BFTs are designed for unreliable and highly dynamic networks yet impose exponential communication complexity. This paper proposes Stable Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SBFT), a BFT communication abstraction that can sustain high throughput and low latency in WAN. SBFT separates the leader from consensus in pipelined BFT consensus and uses an adaptive consensus mechanism to resist dynamic faulty links, maintaining consensus efficiency when network connectivity is high while adapting to dynamic networks with low connectivity. We implemented a prototype of SBFT and tested it on the WAN. The results demonstrate that SBFT has a throughput similar to HotStuff in a fault-free environment but can reduce about 80% of consensus latency. Besides, SBFT retains 40% of the original throughput when the link failure probability is 0.4\n, while the baseline HotStuff retains less than 40% when the link failure probability is only 0.1\n.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TNET.2024.3461872", "Date of Publication": "26 September 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "1063-6692", "Electronic ISSN": "1558-2566"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Sitong Ling", "labs": ["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Zhuotao Liu", "labs": ["Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Qi Li", "labs": ["Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Xinle Du", "labs": ["Huawei, Shenzhen, China"]}, {"name": "Jing Chen", "labs": ["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Ke Xu", "labs": ["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Protocols", "Wide area networks", "Fault tolerant systems", "Fault tolerance", "Throughput", "Complexity theory", "Safety", "Low latency communication", "Delays", "Topology"], "Author Keywords": ["Byzantine fault tolerance", "stable consensus", "adaptive consensus", "dynamic network", "partially connected network"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f474acc", "Title": "Enhancing Manufacturing-as-a-Service Supply Chain Transparency with Master-Slave Multi-Chain and Service Quality Scoring Based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10591969/", "Abstract": "Addressing challenges such as centralization, data tampering, and information silos within traditional supply chain transparency frameworks, we leverage the decentralized, immutable, and traceable attributes of blockchain technology.

Building upon this, to enhance blockchain performance in this context and address the issues of high communication overhead, low consensus efficiency, and the absence of dynamic mechanisms inherent in the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) method, we introduce the Service Quality Scoring Based Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (SQS-PBFT) method.

This paper proposes a trusted hardware-assisted leaderless BFT consensus protocol by offering a hybrid solution for the set BFT problem defined in the RedBelly blockchain. Drawing on previous studies, we present two crucial trusted services: the counter and the collector. Based on these two services, we introduce two primitives to formulate our leaderless BFT protocol: a hybrid verified broadcast (VRB) protocol and a hybrid binary agreement. The hybrid VRB protocol enhances the hybrid reliable broadcast protocol by integrating a verification function. This addition ensures that a broadcast message is verified not only for authentication but also for the correctness of its content. Our hybrid BFT consensus is integrated with these broadcast protocols to deliver binary decisions on all proposals.

As a popular decision fusion technique (DFT), the majority voting function (MVF) finds applications in resolving conflicts, where several independent voters report their opinions on a classification problem. Despite its importance and its various applications in ensemble learning, data crowdsourcing, remote sensing, and data oracles for blockchains, the accuracy of the MVF for the general multiclass classification problem has remained unknown. In this article, we derive a new upper bound on the accuracy of the MVF for the multiclass classification problem. More specifically, we show that under certain conditions, the error rate of the MVF exponentially decays toward 0 as the number of independent voters increases. Conversely, the error rate of the MVF exponentially grows with the number of voters if these conditions are not met. We first explore the problem for voters with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) outputs, where we assume that, given the true classification of the data point, every voter follows the same conditional probability distribution of voting for different classes. Next, we extend our results to encompass independent but nonidentically distributed votes. Using the derived results, we then provide a discussion on the accuracy of the truth discovery algorithms. We show that in the best-case scenarios, truth discovery algorithms operate as an amplified MVF and thereby achieve a small error rate only when the MVF achieves a small error rate too, and vice versa, achieve a large error rate when the MVF also achieves a large error rate. However, in the worst case scenario, the truth discovery algorithms may exhibit a significantly higher error rate than the MVF. Finally, we confirm our theoretical results using numerical simulations.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TNNLS.2024.3387544", "Date of Publication": "23 April 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "2162-237X", "Electronic ISSN": "2162-2388"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Sina Aeeneh", "labs": ["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"]}, {"name": "Nikola Zlatanov", "labs": ["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Innopolis University, Innopolis, Russia"]}, {"name": "Jiangshan Yu", "labs": ["School of Computer Science, The University of Sydney, Camperdown, NSW, Australia"]}], "keywords": {"IEEE Keywords": ["Error analysis", "Discrete Fourier transforms", "Upper bound", "Reliability", "Training", "Sensors", "Crowdsourcing"], "Author Keywords": ["Crowdsourcing", "decision fusion", "ensemble learning", "majority voting", "multiclass classification", "truth discovery"]}}, {"_id": "672a0f5714cae7071f474acf", "Title": "Cybersecurity Solutions and Techniques for Internet of Things Integration in Combat Systems", "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10636816/", "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled pervasive networking and multi-modal sensing, offering various services such as remote operations and augmenting existing processes.

Suitable incentive mechanisms are essential for encouraging user participation. Current MCS work more or less ignores three factors. First, mobile users are assumed to be independent of each other, ignoring social effects. Second, due to the heterogeneity of users, if you just blindly attract users without distinguishing them, the data quality can decrease. Finally, the limited communication resource allocation problem during uploading sensing results is ignored. Therefore, we model the quality-improved and delay-aware incentive mechanism with social concerns as a two-stage Stackelberg game, in which the rational use of social effects not only motivates user participation but also avoids a serious decline in information value due to repetition, and reasonable allocation of communication resources ensures the timeliness of delay-sensitive tasks. Furthermore, data screening, similarity analysis, voting, and reputation are used simultaneously to improve data quality. The Hessian matrix in a multiuser, multitask hyperspace setting is utilized to verify the existence and uniqueness of the game equilibrium.

This statement holds greater validity within the present context. The pressing demand for healthcare solutions with real-time capabilities, affordability, and high precision is crucial in medical research and technology progress. In recent times, there has been a significant advancement in emerging technologies such as AI, IoT, blockchain, and edge computing. These breakthrough developments have led to the creation of various intelligent applications. Smart healthcare applications can be realized by combining robust AI detection and prediction capabilities with edge computing architecture, which offers low computing costs and latency.

However, most of them involve high computation and communication costs. They are not fully reliable, either. Also, AI-based IDS solutions are viewed as black boxes because they cannot justify their decisions. To resolve these issues, we have proposed a framework based on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for securing consumer IoT applications in smart cities. At the beginning of the protocol execution, the participants exchange authenticated data through the blockchain-based AKA procedure.

Some researchers consider the deployment of Metaverse service in a cloud-edge resource architecture, which can satisfy the escalating demand for Metaverse service resources while ensuring both high bandwidth and low latency. However, how to ensure the security and trustworthiness of resource nodes (RNs) in this architecture and thus ensure the reliability and security of Metaverse service is still a challenge. In this paper, we first propose a novel mechanism, named Reliable and Secure Metaverse Service (RSMS), to ensure Metaverse service reliability and security without sacrificing performance. RSMS consists of two protocols: (1) One is a blockchain-based lightweight mutual authentication protocol, which can assure the trustworthiness of heterogeneous Metaverse service RNs dynamically joining a Metaverse service resource pool and then guarantee the security of Metaverse service. (2) The other is a group authentication protocol used to form and maintain a stable and secure Metaverse service group composed of RNs, which ensures the reliability and enhances the security of Metaverse service. The reliability and security of Metaverse service under RSMS are thoroughly discussed, and also informal and formal security analysis are conducted. Additionally, we study the impact of RSMS on Metaverse service throughput, demonstrating its lightweight feature.", "Details": {"DOI": "10.1109/TVT.2024.3418137", "Date of Publication": "24 June 2024", "Publisher": "IEEE", "Published In": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology"}, "issn_info": {"Print ISSN": "0018-9545", "Electronic ISSN": "1939-9359"}, "authors_data": [{"name": "Yanwei Gong", "labs": ["Beijing Key Laboratory of Security and Privacy in Intelligent Transportation, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Xiaolin Chang", "labs": ["Beijing Key Laboratory of Security and Privacy in Intelligent Transportation, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"]}, {"name": "Jelena Mi\u0161i\u0107", "labs": ["Toronto Metropolitan University, Canada"]}, {"name": "Vojislav B.
