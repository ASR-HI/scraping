        "abstract": "Quality pressure is one of the factors affecting processes for software development in its various stages. DevOps is one of the proposed solutions to such pressure. The primary focus of DevOps is to increase the deployment speed, frequency and quality. DevOps is a mixture of different developments and operations to its multitudinous ramifications in software development industries, DevOps have attracted the interest of many researchers. There are considerable literature surveys on this critical innovation in software development, yet, little attention has been given to DevOps impact on software quality. This research is aimed at analyzing the implications of DevOps features on software quality. DevOps can also be referred to a change in organization cultures aimed at removal of gaps between the development and operations of an organization. The adoption of DevOps in an organization provides many benefits including quality but also brings challenges to an organization. This study presents systematic mapping of the impact of DevOps on software quality. The results of this study provide a better understanding of DevOps on software quality for both professionals and researchers working in this area. The study shows research was mainly focused in automation, culture, continuous delivery, fast feedback of DevOps. There is need of further research in many areas of DevOps (for instance: measurement, development of metrics of different stages to assess its performance, culture, practices toward ensuring quality assurance, and quality factors such as usability, efficiency, software maintainability and portability).",

        "abstract": "Systematic implementation of bioinformatics resources for next generation sequencing (NGS)-based clinical testing is an arduous undertaking. One of the key challenges involves developing an ecosystem of information technology infrastructure for enabling scalable and reproducible bioinformatics services that is resilient and secure for handling genetic and protected health information, often embedded in an existing non–bioinformatics-oriented infrastructure. Container technology provides an ideal and infrastructure-agnostic solution for molecular laboratories developing and using bioinformatics pipelines, whether on-premise or using the cloud. A container is a technology that provides a consistent computational environment and enables reproducibility, scalability, and security when developing NGS bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Containers can increase the bioinformatics team's productivity by automating and simplifying the maintenance of complex bioinformatics resources, as well as facilitate validation, version control, and documentation necessary for clinical laboratory regulatory compliance. Although there is increasing popularity in adopting containers for developing NGS bioinformatics pipelines, there is wide variability and inconsistency in the usage of containers that may result in suboptimal performance and potentially compromise the security and privacy of protected health information. In this article, the authors highlight the current state and provide best or recommended practices for building, using containers in NGS bioinformatics solutions in a clinical setting with focus on scalability, optimization, maintainability, and data security.",

The purpose of this work was not only to provide a comprehensive synthesis of existing literature in the field but also to identify gaps and offer insights for adoption in clinical practice. A scoping review was conducted using the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scopus databases. We used MeSH and non-MeSH search terms to identify pertinent articles, with the authors performing 2 screening phases and assigning relevance scores: 148 English language articles most salient to the review were eligible for inclusion; 98 offered the most unique information and these were supplemented by 50 additional sources, yielding 148 references. From the 148 references, we distilled 7 key topic areas, based on a synthesis of the available literature and how that aligned with practitioner needs. The 7 topic areas were machine learning model monitoring; automated retraining systems; ethics, equity, and bias; clinical workflow integration; infrastructure, human resources, and technology stack; regulatory considerations; and financial considerations. This review provides an overview of best practices and knowledge gaps of this domain in health care and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the literature, which may be useful to health care machine learning practitioners and consumers.",

The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0. Finally, we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review, research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in CI-NGWNs to realize Industry 5.0.",

However, unlike general-purpose programming languages (GPLs), IaC scripts use domain-specific languages, and metrics used for GPLs may not be applicable for IaC scripts.

        "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential for facilitating the interaction with robots by enhancing the operator’s spatial understanding as well as providing further cognitive support, e.g. in order to make manual programming processes more efficient and provide on-site simulation. However, we consider major issues that prevent a widespread use of AR towards robotics in industries. Initially, the commissioning of AR devices for robotic applications demands spatial referencing of robots and AR devices. Fiducial markers are a popular artificial aid, but hard to implement in industrial use cases because of additional efforts and a lack of robustness. A further bottleneck for developing AR applications in robotics is the restricted technical and ergonomic maturity of AR devices, e.g. limited local computation and short product life-cycles. Furthermore, benefit through AR in comparison to classic online and offline programming techniques is still unclear for most applicators. In this paper, we present approaches towards a distributed, hardware-agnostic microservice architecture with standard interfaces for an interoperable usage of AR in robotics. Furthermore, we present marker-less pose estimation methods for articulated robot arms as well as mobile robots based on RGB and depth images that serve automatic referencing. Finally, we reveal further application potential of AR in robotics in terms of combining advantages from online and offline programming.",

        "abstract": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) has revolutionized the financial industry in recent years. Industries such as banking, insurance, and investment are experiencing a significant shift due to the growth of DeFi. The decentralized finance market is expanding exponentially, emphasizing the potential of digital currencies and decentralized platforms in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm. It eliminates the need for costly intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, and increases accessibility to financial services for everyone, regardless of their geographic location or economic status. With the enormous increase in cryptocurrency investment, individuals and institutions have started to use DeFi. In this context, understanding the architecture and working mechanisms of different DeFi protocols becomes crucial in creating new and innovative products. This review paper explores various DeFi protocols, including derivatives, decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and borrowing, asset management, and stablecoins. It analyses their internal structure and composability, providing insights into how these protocols can be combined to create new and innovative DeFi products and explore the potential of DeFi in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm.",

        "abstract": "The increasing adoption of natural language processing (NLP) models across industries has led to practitioners’ need for machine learning (ML) systems to handle these models efficiently, from training to serving them in production. However, training, deploying, and updating multiple models can be complex, costly, and time-consuming, mainly when using transformer-based pre-trained language models. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve efficiency and performance through joint training, rather than training separate models. Motivated by this, we present an overview of MTL approaches in NLP, followed by an in-depth discussion of our position on opportunities they introduce to a set of challenges across various ML lifecycle phases including data engineering, model development, deployment, and monitoring. Our position emphasizes the role of transformer-based MTL approaches in streamlining these lifecycle phases, and we assert that our systematic analysis demonstrates how transformer-based MTL in NLP effectively integrates into ML lifecycle phases. Furthermore, we hypothesize that developing a model that combines MTL for periodic re-training, and continual learning for continual updates and new capabilities integration could be practical, although its viability and effectiveness still demand a substantial empirical investigation.",

The primary control system (used for coil currents, plasma current, position, shape and density control) has been upgraded by installing new analog signal inputs/output hardware, connected to two real-time computers that can operate in parallel. In addition, an EtherCAT-based real-time industrial network has been deployed to operate distributed low Input/Output count subsystems, greatly boosting the system flexibility and reach. The majority of TCV’s real-time codes have been ported to this new approach, such as the real-time equilibrium reconstruction (LIUQE), real-time Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics mode analysis algorithms, and a real-time plasma supervision, actuator management and plasma event monitor, including real-time plasma analysis using neural networks, and plasma disruption avoidance control schemes.",

Specifically, it determines what emerging technologies are most studied concerning their impacts on accountants’ role and skills, which research strategies are used in the studies that focus on this theme, and the impacts of the identified emerging technologies on accountants’ skills. It also investigates whether open innovation is an influencing factor in this connection. Methodology: Through a systematic literature review following the five-step approach described by Denyer and Tranfield, the Web of Science and Scopus databases are used as a source of article collection. Thus, our analysis starts with a total of 157 articles. Findings: The main analytical results of the study identify the skills that today’s accountants must have and what role is assigned to them. Practical implications: Professional bodies and regulators may take the results into account in informing the revision of standards, rules, and laws for the new environment. Educational institutions can use the results to adjust their programs to prepare students with the skills employers expect them to have. Contribution: This study provides an integrated understanding of the implications of recent technological developments on the accountant’s role and skills that have been hitherto discussed in the existing literature in a fragmented way. Future research suggestions are also provided, based on identified gaps in the literature, assisting other researchers in finding a way to augment knowledge in this area.",

The primary focus of DevOps is to increase the deployment speed, frequency and quality. DevOps is a mixture of different developments and operations to its multitudinous ramifications in software development industries, DevOps have attracted the interest of many researchers. There are considerable literature surveys on this critical innovation in software development, yet, little attention has been given to DevOps impact on software quality. This research is aimed at analyzing the implications of DevOps features on software quality. DevOps can also be referred to a change in organization cultures aimed at removal of gaps between the development and operations of an organization. The adoption of DevOps in an organization provides many benefits including quality but also brings challenges to an organization. This study presents systematic mapping of the impact of DevOps on software quality. The results of this study provide a better understanding of DevOps on software quality for both professionals and researchers working in this area. The study shows research was mainly focused in automation, culture, continuous delivery, fast feedback of DevOps. There is need of further research in many areas of DevOps (for instance: measurement, development of metrics of different stages to assess its performance, culture, practices toward ensuring quality assurance, and quality factors such as usability, efficiency, software maintainability and portability).",

        "abstract": "Systematic implementation of bioinformatics resources for next generation sequencing (NGS)-based clinical testing is an arduous undertaking. One of the key challenges involves developing an ecosystem of information technology infrastructure for enabling scalable and reproducible bioinformatics services that is resilient and secure for handling genetic and protected health information, often embedded in an existing non–bioinformatics-oriented infrastructure. Container technology provides an ideal and infrastructure-agnostic solution for molecular laboratories developing and using bioinformatics pipelines, whether on-premise or using the cloud. A container is a technology that provides a consistent computational environment and enables reproducibility, scalability, and security when developing NGS bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Containers can increase the bioinformatics team's productivity by automating and simplifying the maintenance of complex bioinformatics resources, as well as facilitate validation, version control, and documentation necessary for clinical laboratory regulatory compliance. Although there is increasing popularity in adopting containers for developing NGS bioinformatics pipelines, there is wide variability and inconsistency in the usage of containers that may result in suboptimal performance and potentially compromise the security and privacy of protected health information. In this article, the authors highlight the current state and provide best or recommended practices for building, using containers in NGS bioinformatics solutions in a clinical setting with focus on scalability, optimization, maintainability, and data security.",

However, the processes that support these tools in deployment, that is, machine learning operations, are still emerging. The purpose of this work was not only to provide a comprehensive synthesis of existing literature in the field but also to identify gaps and offer insights for adoption in clinical practice. A scoping review was conducted using the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scopus databases. We used MeSH and non-MeSH search terms to identify pertinent articles, with the authors performing 2 screening phases and assigning relevance scores: 148 English language articles most salient to the review were eligible for inclusion; 98 offered the most unique information and these were supplemented by 50 additional sources, yielding 148 references. From the 148 references, we distilled 7 key topic areas, based on a synthesis of the available literature and how that aligned with practitioner needs. The 7 topic areas were machine learning model monitoring; automated retraining systems; ethics, equity, and bias; clinical workflow integration; infrastructure, human resources, and technology stack; regulatory considerations; and financial considerations. This review provides an overview of best practices and knowledge gaps of this domain in health care and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the literature, which may be useful to health care machine learning practitioners and consumers.",

The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0. Finally, we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review, research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in CI-NGWNs to realize Industry 5.0.",

On the one hand, although IaC represents an ever-increasing widely adopted practice nowadays, still little is known concerning how to best maintain, speedily evolve, and continuously improve the code behind the IaC practice in a measurable fashion. On the other hand, source code measurements are often computed and analyzed to evaluate the different quality aspects of the software developed. However, unlike general-purpose programming languages (GPLs), IaC scripts use domain-specific languages, and metrics used for GPLs may not be applicable for IaC scripts. This article proposes a catalog consisting of 46 metrics to identify IaC properties focusing on Ansible, one of the most popular IaC language to date, and shows how they can be used to analyze IaC scripts.",

However, we consider major issues that prevent a widespread use of AR towards robotics in industries. Initially, the commissioning of AR devices for robotic applications demands spatial referencing of robots and AR devices. Fiducial markers are a popular artificial aid, but hard to implement in industrial use cases because of additional efforts and a lack of robustness. A further bottleneck for developing AR applications in robotics is the restricted technical and ergonomic maturity of AR devices, e.g. limited local computation and short product life-cycles. Furthermore, benefit through AR in comparison to classic online and offline programming techniques is still unclear for most applicators. In this paper, we present approaches towards a distributed, hardware-agnostic microservice architecture with standard interfaces for an interoperable usage of AR in robotics. Furthermore, we present marker-less pose estimation methods for articulated robot arms as well as mobile robots based on RGB and depth images that serve automatic referencing. Finally, we reveal further application potential of AR in robotics in terms of combining advantages from online and offline programming.",

However, training, deploying, and updating multiple models can be complex, costly, and time-consuming, mainly when using transformer-based pre-trained language models. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve efficiency and performance through joint training, rather than training separate models. Motivated by this, we present an overview of MTL approaches in NLP, followed by an in-depth discussion of our position on opportunities they introduce to a set of challenges across various ML lifecycle phases including data engineering, model development, deployment, and monitoring. Our position emphasizes the role of transformer-based MTL approaches in streamlining these lifecycle phases, and we assert that our systematic analysis demonstrates how transformer-based MTL in NLP effectively integrates into ML lifecycle phases. Furthermore, we hypothesize that developing a model that combines MTL for periodic re-training, and continual learning for continual updates and new capabilities integration could be practical, although its viability and effectiveness still demand a substantial empirical investigation.",

The control system of the TCV tokamak has recently seen a major upgrade in terms of its hardware and software components. Control algorithms are entirely programmed and tested in MATLAB/Simulink(R), executable code is automatically generated and interfaced to run-time parameters and signals through introspection using the MARTe2 software framework. The primary control system (used for coil currents, plasma current, position, shape and density control) has been upgraded by installing new analog signal inputs/output hardware, connected to two real-time computers that can operate in parallel. In addition, an EtherCAT-based real-time industrial network has been deployed to operate distributed low Input/Output count subsystems, greatly boosting the system flexibility and reach. The majority of TCV’s real-time codes have been ported to this new approach, such as the real-time equilibrium reconstruction (LIUQE), real-time Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics mode analysis algorithms, and a real-time plasma supervision, actuator management and plasma event monitor, including real-time plasma analysis using neural networks, and plasma disruption avoidance control schemes.",

Specifically, it determines what emerging technologies are most studied concerning their impacts on accountants’ role and skills, which research strategies are used in the studies that focus on this theme, and the impacts of the identified emerging technologies on accountants’ skills. It also investigates whether open innovation is an influencing factor in this connection. Methodology: Through a systematic literature review following the five-step approach described by Denyer and Tranfield, the Web of Science and Scopus databases are used as a source of article collection. Thus, our analysis starts with a total of 157 articles. Findings: The main analytical results of the study identify the skills that today’s accountants must have and what role is assigned to them. Practical implications: Professional bodies and regulators may take the results into account in informing the revision of standards, rules, and laws for the new environment. Educational institutions can use the results to adjust their programs to prepare students with the skills employers expect them to have. Contribution: This study provides an integrated understanding of the implications of recent technological developments on the accountant’s role and skills that have been hitherto discussed in the existing literature in a fragmented way. Future research suggestions are also provided, based on identified gaps in the literature, assisting other researchers in finding a way to augment knowledge in this area.",

        "abstract": "Quality pressure is one of the factors affecting processes for software development in its various stages. DevOps is one of the proposed solutions to such pressure. The primary focus of DevOps is to increase the deployment speed, frequency and quality. DevOps is a mixture of different developments and operations to its multitudinous ramifications in software development industries, DevOps have attracted the interest of many researchers. There are considerable literature surveys on this critical innovation in software development, yet, little attention has been given to DevOps impact on software quality. This research is aimed at analyzing the implications of DevOps features on software quality. DevOps can also be referred to a change in organization cultures aimed at removal of gaps between the development and operations of an organization. The adoption of DevOps in an organization provides many benefits including quality but also brings challenges to an organization. This study presents systematic mapping of the impact of DevOps on software quality. The results of this study provide a better understanding of DevOps on software quality for both professionals and researchers working in this area. The study shows research was mainly focused in automation, culture, continuous delivery, fast feedback of DevOps. There is need of further research in many areas of DevOps (for instance: measurement, development of metrics of different stages to assess its performance, culture, practices toward ensuring quality assurance, and quality factors such as usability, efficiency, software maintainability and portability).",

One of the key challenges involves developing an ecosystem of information technology infrastructure for enabling scalable and reproducible bioinformatics services that is resilient and secure for handling genetic and protected health information, often embedded in an existing non–bioinformatics-oriented infrastructure. Container technology provides an ideal and infrastructure-agnostic solution for molecular laboratories developing and using bioinformatics pipelines, whether on-premise or using the cloud. A container is a technology that provides a consistent computational environment and enables reproducibility, scalability, and security when developing NGS bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Containers can increase the bioinformatics team's productivity by automating and simplifying the maintenance of complex bioinformatics resources, as well as facilitate validation, version control, and documentation necessary for clinical laboratory regulatory compliance. Although there is increasing popularity in adopting containers for developing NGS bioinformatics pipelines, there is wide variability and inconsistency in the usage of containers that may result in suboptimal performance and potentially compromise the security and privacy of protected health information. In this article, the authors highlight the current state and provide best or recommended practices for building, using containers in NGS bioinformatics solutions in a clinical setting with focus on scalability, optimization, maintainability, and data security.",

The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0.

        "abstract": "Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) is a practice to implement continuous deployment by allowing management and provisioning of infrastructure through the definition of machine-readable files and automation around them, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. On the one hand, although IaC represents an ever-increasing widely adopted practice nowadays, still little is known concerning how to best maintain, speedily evolve, and continuously improve the code behind the IaC practice in a measurable fashion. On the other hand, source code measurements are often computed and analyzed to evaluate the different quality aspects of the software developed. However, unlike general-purpose programming languages (GPLs), IaC scripts use domain-specific languages, and metrics used for GPLs may not be applicable for IaC scripts. This article proposes a catalog consisting of 46 metrics to identify IaC properties focusing on Ansible, one of the most popular IaC language to date, and shows how they can be used to analyze IaC scripts.",

However, we consider major issues that prevent a widespread use of AR towards robotics in industries. Initially, the commissioning of AR devices for robotic applications demands spatial referencing of robots and AR devices. Fiducial markers are a popular artificial aid, but hard to implement in industrial use cases because of additional efforts and a lack of robustness. A further bottleneck for developing AR applications in robotics is the restricted technical and ergonomic maturity of AR devices, e.g. limited local computation and short product life-cycles. Furthermore, benefit through AR in comparison to classic online and offline programming techniques is still unclear for most applicators. In this paper, we present approaches towards a distributed, hardware-agnostic microservice architecture with standard interfaces for an interoperable usage of AR in robotics. Furthermore, we present marker-less pose estimation methods for articulated robot arms as well as mobile robots based on RGB and depth images that serve automatic referencing. Finally, we reveal further application potential of AR in robotics in terms of combining advantages from online and offline programming.",

Industries such as banking, insurance, and investment are experiencing a significant shift due to the growth of DeFi. The decentralized finance market is expanding exponentially, emphasizing the potential of digital currencies and decentralized platforms in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm. It eliminates the need for costly intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, and increases accessibility to financial services for everyone, regardless of their geographic location or economic status. With the enormous increase in cryptocurrency investment, individuals and institutions have started to use DeFi. In this context, understanding the architecture and working mechanisms of different DeFi protocols becomes crucial in creating new and innovative products. This review paper explores various DeFi protocols, including derivatives, decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and borrowing, asset management, and stablecoins. It analyses their internal structure and composability, providing insights into how these protocols can be combined to create new and innovative DeFi products and explore the potential of DeFi in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm.",

However, training, deploying, and updating multiple models can be complex, costly, and time-consuming, mainly when using transformer-based pre-trained language models. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve efficiency and performance through joint training, rather than training separate models. Motivated by this, we present an overview of MTL approaches in NLP, followed by an in-depth discussion of our position on opportunities they introduce to a set of challenges across various ML lifecycle phases including data engineering, model development, deployment, and monitoring. Our position emphasizes the role of transformer-based MTL approaches in streamlining these lifecycle phases, and we assert that our systematic analysis demonstrates how transformer-based MTL in NLP effectively integrates into ML lifecycle phases. Furthermore, we hypothesize that developing a model that combines MTL for periodic re-training, and continual learning for continual updates and new capabilities integration could be practical, although its viability and effectiveness still demand a substantial empirical investigation.",

The primary control system (used for coil currents, plasma current, position, shape and density control) has been upgraded by installing new analog signal inputs/output hardware, connected to two real-time computers that can operate in parallel. In addition, an EtherCAT-based real-time industrial network has been deployed to operate distributed low Input/Output count subsystems, greatly boosting the system flexibility and reach. The majority of TCV’s real-time codes have been ported to this new approach, such as the real-time equilibrium reconstruction (LIUQE), real-time Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics mode analysis algorithms, and a real-time plasma supervision, actuator management and plasma event monitor, including real-time plasma analysis using neural networks, and plasma disruption avoidance control schemes.",

Specifically, it determines what emerging technologies are most studied concerning their impacts on accountants’ role and skills, which research strategies are used in the studies that focus on this theme, and the impacts of the identified emerging technologies on accountants’ skills. It also investigates whether open innovation is an influencing factor in this connection. Methodology: Through a systematic literature review following the five-step approach described by Denyer and Tranfield, the Web of Science and Scopus databases are used as a source of article collection. Thus, our analysis starts with a total of 157 articles. Findings: The main analytical results of the study identify the skills that today’s accountants must have and what role is assigned to them. Practical implications: Professional bodies and regulators may take the results into account in informing the revision of standards, rules, and laws for the new environment. Educational institutions can use the results to adjust their programs to prepare students with the skills employers expect them to have. Contribution: This study provides an integrated understanding of the implications of recent technological developments on the accountant’s role and skills that have been hitherto discussed in the existing literature in a fragmented way. Future research suggestions are also provided, based on identified gaps in the literature, assisting other researchers in finding a way to augment knowledge in this area.",

The primary focus of DevOps is to increase the deployment speed, frequency and quality. DevOps is a mixture of different developments and operations to its multitudinous ramifications in software development industries, DevOps have attracted the interest of many researchers. There are considerable literature surveys on this critical innovation in software development, yet, little attention has been given to DevOps impact on software quality. This research is aimed at analyzing the implications of DevOps features on software quality. DevOps can also be referred to a change in organization cultures aimed at removal of gaps between the development and operations of an organization. The adoption of DevOps in an organization provides many benefits including quality but also brings challenges to an organization. This study presents systematic mapping of the impact of DevOps on software quality. The results of this study provide a better understanding of DevOps on software quality for both professionals and researchers working in this area. The study shows research was mainly focused in automation, culture, continuous delivery, fast feedback of DevOps. There is need of further research in many areas of DevOps (for instance: measurement, development of metrics of different stages to assess its performance, culture, practices toward ensuring quality assurance, and quality factors such as usability, efficiency, software maintainability and portability).",

This paper carries out a “grey literature” (non-academic) review on BizDevOps. Data is collected from reports, articles, webpages, and blog posts to capture the professionals’ insights on BizDevOps. We develop a conceptual framework for BizDevOps that organizes and integrates concepts and constructs embedded in the grey literature. Based on this, the paper offers insights for organizations aiming to move towards the BizDevOps approach and identifies research opportunities in the BizDevOps area.",

        "abstract": "Systematic implementation of bioinformatics resources for next generation sequencing (NGS)-based clinical testing is an arduous undertaking. One of the key challenges involves developing an ecosystem of information technology infrastructure for enabling scalable and reproducible bioinformatics services that is resilient and secure for handling genetic and protected health information, often embedded in an existing non–bioinformatics-oriented infrastructure. Container technology provides an ideal and infrastructure-agnostic solution for molecular laboratories developing and using bioinformatics pipelines, whether on-premise or using the cloud. A container is a technology that provides a consistent computational environment and enables reproducibility, scalability, and security when developing NGS bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Containers can increase the bioinformatics team's productivity by automating and simplifying the maintenance of complex bioinformatics resources, as well as facilitate validation, version control, and documentation necessary for clinical laboratory regulatory compliance. Although there is increasing popularity in adopting containers for developing NGS bioinformatics pipelines, there is wide variability and inconsistency in the usage of containers that may result in suboptimal performance and potentially compromise the security and privacy of protected health information. In this article, the authors highlight the current state and provide best or recommended practices for building, using containers in NGS bioinformatics solutions in a clinical setting with focus on scalability, optimization, maintainability, and data security.",

A scoping review was conducted using the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scopus databases. We used MeSH and non-MeSH search terms to identify pertinent articles, with the authors performing 2 screening phases and assigning relevance scores: 148 English language articles most salient to the review were eligible for inclusion; 98 offered the most unique information and these were supplemented by 50 additional sources, yielding 148 references. From the 148 references, we distilled 7 key topic areas, based on a synthesis of the available literature and how that aligned with practitioner needs. The 7 topic areas were machine learning model monitoring; automated retraining systems; ethics, equity, and bias; clinical workflow integration; infrastructure, human resources, and technology stack; regulatory considerations; and financial considerations. This review provides an overview of best practices and knowledge gaps of this domain in health care and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the literature, which may be useful to health care machine learning practitioners and consumers.",

The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0. Finally, we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review, research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in CI-NGWNs to realize Industry 5.0.",

However, unlike general-purpose programming languages (GPLs), IaC scripts use domain-specific languages, and metrics used for GPLs may not be applicable for IaC scripts.

However, we consider major issues that prevent a widespread use of AR towards robotics in industries. Initially, the commissioning of AR devices for robotic applications demands spatial referencing of robots and AR devices. Fiducial markers are a popular artificial aid, but hard to implement in industrial use cases because of additional efforts and a lack of robustness. A further bottleneck for developing AR applications in robotics is the restricted technical and ergonomic maturity of AR devices, e.g. limited local computation and short product life-cycles. Furthermore, benefit through AR in comparison to classic online and offline programming techniques is still unclear for most applicators. In this paper, we present approaches towards a distributed, hardware-agnostic microservice architecture with standard interfaces for an interoperable usage of AR in robotics. Furthermore, we present marker-less pose estimation methods for articulated robot arms as well as mobile robots based on RGB and depth images that serve automatic referencing. Finally, we reveal further application potential of AR in robotics in terms of combining advantages from online and offline programming.",

        "abstract": "Decentralized finance (DeFi) has revolutionized the financial industry in recent years. Industries such as banking, insurance, and investment are experiencing a significant shift due to the growth of DeFi. The decentralized finance market is expanding exponentially, emphasizing the potential of digital currencies and decentralized platforms in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm. It eliminates the need for costly intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, and increases accessibility to financial services for everyone, regardless of their geographic location or economic status. With the enormous increase in cryptocurrency investment, individuals and institutions have started to use DeFi. In this context, understanding the architecture and working mechanisms of different DeFi protocols becomes crucial in creating new and innovative products. This review paper explores various DeFi protocols, including derivatives, decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and borrowing, asset management, and stablecoins. It analyses their internal structure and composability, providing insights into how these protocols can be combined to create new and innovative DeFi products and explore the potential of DeFi in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm.",

        "abstract": "The increasing adoption of natural language processing (NLP) models across industries has led to practitioners’ need for machine learning (ML) systems to handle these models efficiently, from training to serving them in production. However, training, deploying, and updating multiple models can be complex, costly, and time-consuming, mainly when using transformer-based pre-trained language models. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve efficiency and performance through joint training, rather than training separate models. Motivated by this, we present an overview of MTL approaches in NLP, followed by an in-depth discussion of our position on opportunities they introduce to a set of challenges across various ML lifecycle phases including data engineering, model development, deployment, and monitoring. Our position emphasizes the role of transformer-based MTL approaches in streamlining these lifecycle phases, and we assert that our systematic analysis demonstrates how transformer-based MTL in NLP effectively integrates into ML lifecycle phases. Furthermore, we hypothesize that developing a model that combines MTL for periodic re-training, and continual learning for continual updates and new capabilities integration could be practical, although its viability and effectiveness still demand a substantial empirical investigation.",

The control system of the TCV tokamak has recently seen a major upgrade in terms of its hardware and software components. Control algorithms are entirely programmed and tested in MATLAB/Simulink(R), executable code is automatically generated and interfaced to run-time parameters and signals through introspection using the MARTe2 software framework. The primary control system (used for coil currents, plasma current, position, shape and density control) has been upgraded by installing new analog signal inputs/output hardware, connected to two real-time computers that can operate in parallel. In addition, an EtherCAT-based real-time industrial network has been deployed to operate distributed low Input/Output count subsystems, greatly boosting the system flexibility and reach. The majority of TCV’s real-time codes have been ported to this new approach, such as the real-time equilibrium reconstruction (LIUQE), real-time Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics mode analysis algorithms, and a real-time plasma supervision, actuator management and plasma event monitor, including real-time plasma analysis using neural networks, and plasma disruption avoidance control schemes.",

Specifically, it determines what emerging technologies are most studied concerning their impacts on accountants’ role and skills, which research strategies are used in the studies that focus on this theme, and the impacts of the identified emerging technologies on accountants’ skills. It also investigates whether open innovation is an influencing factor in this connection. Methodology: Through a systematic literature review following the five-step approach described by Denyer and Tranfield, the Web of Science and Scopus databases are used as a source of article collection. Thus, our analysis starts with a total of 157 articles. Findings: The main analytical results of the study identify the skills that today’s accountants must have and what role is assigned to them. Practical implications: Professional bodies and regulators may take the results into account in informing the revision of standards, rules, and laws for the new environment. Educational institutions can use the results to adjust their programs to prepare students with the skills employers expect them to have. Contribution: This study provides an integrated understanding of the implications of recent technological developments on the accountant’s role and skills that have been hitherto discussed in the existing literature in a fragmented way. Future research suggestions are also provided, based on identified gaps in the literature, assisting other researchers in finding a way to augment knowledge in this area.",

The primary focus of DevOps is to increase the deployment speed, frequency and quality. DevOps is a mixture of different developments and operations to its multitudinous ramifications in software development industries, DevOps have attracted the interest of many researchers. There are considerable literature surveys on this critical innovation in software development, yet, little attention has been given to DevOps impact on software quality. This research is aimed at analyzing the implications of DevOps features on software quality. DevOps can also be referred to a change in organization cultures aimed at removal of gaps between the development and operations of an organization. The adoption of DevOps in an organization provides many benefits including quality but also brings challenges to an organization. This study presents systematic mapping of the impact of DevOps on software quality. The results of this study provide a better understanding of DevOps on software quality for both professionals and researchers working in this area. The study shows research was mainly focused in automation, culture, continuous delivery, fast feedback of DevOps. There is need of further research in many areas of DevOps (for instance: measurement, development of metrics of different stages to assess its performance, culture, practices toward ensuring quality assurance, and quality factors such as usability, efficiency, software maintainability and portability).",

One of the key challenges involves developing an ecosystem of information technology infrastructure for enabling scalable and reproducible bioinformatics services that is resilient and secure for handling genetic and protected health information, often embedded in an existing non–bioinformatics-oriented infrastructure. Container technology provides an ideal and infrastructure-agnostic solution for molecular laboratories developing and using bioinformatics pipelines, whether on-premise or using the cloud. A container is a technology that provides a consistent computational environment and enables reproducibility, scalability, and security when developing NGS bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Containers can increase the bioinformatics team's productivity by automating and simplifying the maintenance of complex bioinformatics resources, as well as facilitate validation, version control, and documentation necessary for clinical laboratory regulatory compliance. Although there is increasing popularity in adopting containers for developing NGS bioinformatics pipelines, there is wide variability and inconsistency in the usage of containers that may result in suboptimal performance and potentially compromise the security and privacy of protected health information. In this article, the authors highlight the current state and provide best or recommended practices for building, using containers in NGS bioinformatics solutions in a clinical setting with focus on scalability, optimization, maintainability, and data security.",

We used MeSH and non-MeSH search terms to identify pertinent articles, with the authors performing 2 screening phases and assigning relevance scores: 148 English language articles most salient to the review were eligible for inclusion; 98 offered the most unique information and these were supplemented by 50 additional sources, yielding 148 references. From the 148 references, we distilled 7 key topic areas, based on a synthesis of the available literature and how that aligned with practitioner needs. The 7 topic areas were machine learning model monitoring; automated retraining systems; ethics, equity, and bias; clinical workflow integration; infrastructure, human resources, and technology stack; regulatory considerations; and financial considerations. This review provides an overview of best practices and knowledge gaps of this domain in health care and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the literature, which may be useful to health care machine learning practitioners and consumers.",

        "abstract": "Industry 5.0 vision, a step toward the next industrial revolution and enhancement to Industry 4.0, conceives the new goals of resilient, sustainable, and human-centric approaches in diverse emerging applications such as factories-of-the-future and digital society. The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0. Finally, we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review, research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in CI-NGWNs to realize Industry 5.0.",

On the one hand, although IaC represents an ever-increasing widely adopted practice nowadays, still little is known concerning how to best maintain, speedily evolve, and continuously improve the code behind the IaC practice in a measurable fashion. On the other hand, source code measurements are often computed and analyzed to evaluate the different quality aspects of the software developed. However, unlike general-purpose programming languages (GPLs), IaC scripts use domain-specific languages, and metrics used for GPLs may not be applicable for IaC scripts. This article proposes a catalog consisting of 46 metrics to identify IaC properties focusing on Ansible, one of the most popular IaC language to date, and shows how they can be used to analyze IaC scripts.",

        "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential for facilitating the interaction with robots by enhancing the operator’s spatial understanding as well as providing further cognitive support, e.g. in order to make manual programming processes more efficient and provide on-site simulation. However, we consider major issues that prevent a widespread use of AR towards robotics in industries. Initially, the commissioning of AR devices for robotic applications demands spatial referencing of robots and AR devices. Fiducial markers are a popular artificial aid, but hard to implement in industrial use cases because of additional efforts and a lack of robustness. A further bottleneck for developing AR applications in robotics is the restricted technical and ergonomic maturity of AR devices, e.g. limited local computation and short product life-cycles. Furthermore, benefit through AR in comparison to classic online and offline programming techniques is still unclear for most applicators. In this paper, we present approaches towards a distributed, hardware-agnostic microservice architecture with standard interfaces for an interoperable usage of AR in robotics. Furthermore, we present marker-less pose estimation methods for articulated robot arms as well as mobile robots based on RGB and depth images that serve automatic referencing. Finally, we reveal further application potential of AR in robotics in terms of combining advantages from online and offline programming.",

Industries such as banking, insurance, and investment are experiencing a significant shift due to the growth of DeFi. The decentralized finance market is expanding exponentially, emphasizing the potential of digital currencies and decentralized platforms in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm. It eliminates the need for costly intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, and increases accessibility to financial services for everyone, regardless of their geographic location or economic status. With the enormous increase in cryptocurrency investment, individuals and institutions have started to use DeFi. In this context, understanding the architecture and working mechanisms of different DeFi protocols becomes crucial in creating new and innovative products. This review paper explores various DeFi protocols, including derivatives, decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and borrowing, asset management, and stablecoins.

However, training, deploying, and updating multiple models can be complex, costly, and time-consuming, mainly when using transformer-based pre-trained language models. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve efficiency and performance through joint training, rather than training separate models. Motivated by this, we present an overview of MTL approaches in NLP, followed by an in-depth discussion of our position on opportunities they introduce to a set of challenges across various ML lifecycle phases including data engineering, model development, deployment, and monitoring. Our position emphasizes the role of transformer-based MTL approaches in streamlining these lifecycle phases, and we assert that our systematic analysis demonstrates how transformer-based MTL in NLP effectively integrates into ML lifecycle phases. Furthermore, we hypothesize that developing a model that combines MTL for periodic re-training, and continual learning for continual updates and new capabilities integration could be practical, although its viability and effectiveness still demand a substantial empirical investigation.",

The primary control system (used for coil currents, plasma current, position, shape and density control) has been upgraded by installing new analog signal inputs/output hardware, connected to two real-time computers that can operate in parallel. In addition, an EtherCAT-based real-time industrial network has been deployed to operate distributed low Input/Output count subsystems, greatly boosting the system flexibility and reach. The majority of TCV’s real-time codes have been ported to this new approach, such as the real-time equilibrium reconstruction (LIUQE), real-time Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics mode analysis algorithms, and a real-time plasma supervision, actuator management and plasma event monitor, including real-time plasma analysis using neural networks, and plasma disruption avoidance control schemes.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This paper reviews the recent accounting literature focusing on emerging technologies’ impacts on accountants’ role and skills. Specifically, it determines what emerging technologies are most studied concerning their impacts on accountants’ role and skills, which research strategies are used in the studies that focus on this theme, and the impacts of the identified emerging technologies on accountants’ skills. It also investigates whether open innovation is an influencing factor in this connection. Methodology: Through a systematic literature review following the five-step approach described by Denyer and Tranfield, the Web of Science and Scopus databases are used as a source of article collection. Thus, our analysis starts with a total of 157 articles. Findings: The main analytical results of the study identify the skills that today’s accountants must have and what role is assigned to them. Practical implications: Professional bodies and regulators may take the results into account in informing the revision of standards, rules, and laws for the new environment. Educational institutions can use the results to adjust their programs to prepare students with the skills employers expect them to have. Contribution: This study provides an integrated understanding of the implications of recent technological developments on the accountant’s role and skills that have been hitherto discussed in the existing literature in a fragmented way. Future research suggestions are also provided, based on identified gaps in the literature, assisting other researchers in finding a way to augment knowledge in this area.",

        "abstract": "Quality pressure is one of the factors affecting processes for software development in its various stages. DevOps is one of the proposed solutions to such pressure. The primary focus of DevOps is to increase the deployment speed, frequency and quality. DevOps is a mixture of different developments and operations to its multitudinous ramifications in software development industries, DevOps have attracted the interest of many researchers. There are considerable literature surveys on this critical innovation in software development, yet, little attention has been given to DevOps impact on software quality. This research is aimed at analyzing the implications of DevOps features on software quality. DevOps can also be referred to a change in organization cultures aimed at removal of gaps between the development and operations of an organization. The adoption of DevOps in an organization provides many benefits including quality but also brings challenges to an organization. This study presents systematic mapping of the impact of DevOps on software quality. The results of this study provide a better understanding of DevOps on software quality for both professionals and researchers working in this area. The study shows research was mainly focused in automation, culture, continuous delivery, fast feedback of DevOps. There is need of further research in many areas of DevOps (for instance: measurement, development of metrics of different stages to assess its performance, culture, practices toward ensuring quality assurance, and quality factors such as usability, efficiency, software maintainability and portability).",

        "abstract": "Systematic implementation of bioinformatics resources for next generation sequencing (NGS)-based clinical testing is an arduous undertaking. One of the key challenges involves developing an ecosystem of information technology infrastructure for enabling scalable and reproducible bioinformatics services that is resilient and secure for handling genetic and protected health information, often embedded in an existing non–bioinformatics-oriented infrastructure. Container technology provides an ideal and infrastructure-agnostic solution for molecular laboratories developing and using bioinformatics pipelines, whether on-premise or using the cloud. A container is a technology that provides a consistent computational environment and enables reproducibility, scalability, and security when developing NGS bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Containers can increase the bioinformatics team's productivity by automating and simplifying the maintenance of complex bioinformatics resources, as well as facilitate validation, version control, and documentation necessary for clinical laboratory regulatory compliance. Although there is increasing popularity in adopting containers for developing NGS bioinformatics pipelines, there is wide variability and inconsistency in the usage of containers that may result in suboptimal performance and potentially compromise the security and privacy of protected health information. In this article, the authors highlight the current state and provide best or recommended practices for building, using containers in NGS bioinformatics solutions in a clinical setting with focus on scalability, optimization, maintainability, and data security.",

The purpose of this work was not only to provide a comprehensive synthesis of existing literature in the field but also to identify gaps and offer insights for adoption in clinical practice. A scoping review was conducted using the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scopus databases. We used MeSH and non-MeSH search terms to identify pertinent articles, with the authors performing 2 screening phases and assigning relevance scores: 148 English language articles most salient to the review were eligible for inclusion; 98 offered the most unique information and these were supplemented by 50 additional sources, yielding 148 references. From the 148 references, we distilled 7 key topic areas, based on a synthesis of the available literature and how that aligned with practitioner needs. The 7 topic areas were machine learning model monitoring; automated retraining systems; ethics, equity, and bias; clinical workflow integration; infrastructure, human resources, and technology stack; regulatory considerations; and financial considerations. This review provides an overview of best practices and knowledge gaps of this domain in health care and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the literature, which may be useful to health care machine learning practitioners and consumers.",

The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0.

However, unlike general-purpose programming languages (GPLs), IaC scripts use domain-specific languages, and metrics used for GPLs may not be applicable for IaC scripts.

        "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential for facilitating the interaction with robots by enhancing the operator’s spatial understanding as well as providing further cognitive support, e.g. in order to make manual programming processes more efficient and provide on-site simulation. However, we consider major issues that prevent a widespread use of AR towards robotics in industries. Initially, the commissioning of AR devices for robotic applications demands spatial referencing of robots and AR devices. Fiducial markers are a popular artificial aid, but hard to implement in industrial use cases because of additional efforts and a lack of robustness. A further bottleneck for developing AR applications in robotics is the restricted technical and ergonomic maturity of AR devices, e.g. limited local computation and short product life-cycles. Furthermore, benefit through AR in comparison to classic online and offline programming techniques is still unclear for most applicators. In this paper, we present approaches towards a distributed, hardware-agnostic microservice architecture with standard interfaces for an interoperable usage of AR in robotics. Furthermore, we present marker-less pose estimation methods for articulated robot arms as well as mobile robots based on RGB and depth images that serve automatic referencing. Finally, we reveal further application potential of AR in robotics in terms of combining advantages from online and offline programming.",

Industries such as banking, insurance, and investment are experiencing a significant shift due to the growth of DeFi. The decentralized finance market is expanding exponentially, emphasizing the potential of digital currencies and decentralized platforms in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm. It eliminates the need for costly intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, and increases accessibility to financial services for everyone, regardless of their geographic location or economic status. With the enormous increase in cryptocurrency investment, individuals and institutions have started to use DeFi. In this context, understanding the architecture and working mechanisms of different DeFi protocols becomes crucial in creating new and innovative products. This review paper explores various DeFi protocols, including derivatives, decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and borrowing, asset management, and stablecoins. It analyses their internal structure and composability, providing insights into how these protocols can be combined to create new and innovative DeFi products and explore the potential of DeFi in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm.",

        "abstract": "The increasing adoption of natural language processing (NLP) models across industries has led to practitioners’ need for machine learning (ML) systems to handle these models efficiently, from training to serving them in production. However, training, deploying, and updating multiple models can be complex, costly, and time-consuming, mainly when using transformer-based pre-trained language models. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve efficiency and performance through joint training, rather than training separate models. Motivated by this, we present an overview of MTL approaches in NLP, followed by an in-depth discussion of our position on opportunities they introduce to a set of challenges across various ML lifecycle phases including data engineering, model development, deployment, and monitoring. Our position emphasizes the role of transformer-based MTL approaches in streamlining these lifecycle phases, and we assert that our systematic analysis demonstrates how transformer-based MTL in NLP effectively integrates into ML lifecycle phases. Furthermore, we hypothesize that developing a model that combines MTL for periodic re-training, and continual learning for continual updates and new capabilities integration could be practical, although its viability and effectiveness still demand a substantial empirical investigation.",

The primary control system (used for coil currents, plasma current, position, shape and density control) has been upgraded by installing new analog signal inputs/output hardware, connected to two real-time computers that can operate in parallel. In addition, an EtherCAT-based real-time industrial network has been deployed to operate distributed low Input/Output count subsystems, greatly boosting the system flexibility and reach. The majority of TCV’s real-time codes have been ported to this new approach, such as the real-time equilibrium reconstruction (LIUQE), real-time Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics mode analysis algorithms, and a real-time plasma supervision, actuator management and plasma event monitor, including real-time plasma analysis using neural networks, and plasma disruption avoidance control schemes.",

Specifically, it determines what emerging technologies are most studied concerning their impacts on accountants’ role and skills, which research strategies are used in the studies that focus on this theme, and the impacts of the identified emerging technologies on accountants’ skills. It also investigates whether open innovation is an influencing factor in this connection. Methodology: Through a systematic literature review following the five-step approach described by Denyer and Tranfield, the Web of Science and Scopus databases are used as a source of article collection. Thus, our analysis starts with a total of 157 articles. Findings: The main analytical results of the study identify the skills that today’s accountants must have and what role is assigned to them. Practical implications: Professional bodies and regulators may take the results into account in informing the revision of standards, rules, and laws for the new environment. Educational institutions can use the results to adjust their programs to prepare students with the skills employers expect them to have. Contribution: This study provides an integrated understanding of the implications of recent technological developments on the accountant’s role and skills that have been hitherto discussed in the existing literature in a fragmented way. Future research suggestions are also provided, based on identified gaps in the literature, assisting other researchers in finding a way to augment knowledge in this area.",

The primary focus of DevOps is to increase the deployment speed, frequency and quality. DevOps is a mixture of different developments and operations to its multitudinous ramifications in software development industries, DevOps have attracted the interest of many researchers. There are considerable literature surveys on this critical innovation in software development, yet, little attention has been given to DevOps impact on software quality. This research is aimed at analyzing the implications of DevOps features on software quality. DevOps can also be referred to a change in organization cultures aimed at removal of gaps between the development and operations of an organization. The adoption of DevOps in an organization provides many benefits including quality but also brings challenges to an organization. This study presents systematic mapping of the impact of DevOps on software quality. The results of this study provide a better understanding of DevOps on software quality for both professionals and researchers working in this area. The study shows research was mainly focused in automation, culture, continuous delivery, fast feedback of DevOps. There is need of further research in many areas of DevOps (for instance: measurement, development of metrics of different stages to assess its performance, culture, practices toward ensuring quality assurance, and quality factors such as usability, efficiency, software maintainability and portability).",

        "abstract": "Systematic implementation of bioinformatics resources for next generation sequencing (NGS)-based clinical testing is an arduous undertaking. One of the key challenges involves developing an ecosystem of information technology infrastructure for enabling scalable and reproducible bioinformatics services that is resilient and secure for handling genetic and protected health information, often embedded in an existing non–bioinformatics-oriented infrastructure. Container technology provides an ideal and infrastructure-agnostic solution for molecular laboratories developing and using bioinformatics pipelines, whether on-premise or using the cloud. A container is a technology that provides a consistent computational environment and enables reproducibility, scalability, and security when developing NGS bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Containers can increase the bioinformatics team's productivity by automating and simplifying the maintenance of complex bioinformatics resources, as well as facilitate validation, version control, and documentation necessary for clinical laboratory regulatory compliance. Although there is increasing popularity in adopting containers for developing NGS bioinformatics pipelines, there is wide variability and inconsistency in the usage of containers that may result in suboptimal performance and potentially compromise the security and privacy of protected health information. In this article, the authors highlight the current state and provide best or recommended practices for building, using containers in NGS bioinformatics solutions in a clinical setting with focus on scalability, optimization, maintainability, and data security.",

However, the processes that support these tools in deployment, that is, machine learning operations, are still emerging. The purpose of this work was not only to provide a comprehensive synthesis of existing literature in the field but also to identify gaps and offer insights for adoption in clinical practice. A scoping review was conducted using the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scopus databases. We used MeSH and non-MeSH search terms to identify pertinent articles, with the authors performing 2 screening phases and assigning relevance scores: 148 English language articles most salient to the review were eligible for inclusion; 98 offered the most unique information and these were supplemented by 50 additional sources, yielding 148 references. From the 148 references, we distilled 7 key topic areas, based on a synthesis of the available literature and how that aligned with practitioner needs. The 7 topic areas were machine learning model monitoring; automated retraining systems; ethics, equity, and bias; clinical workflow integration; infrastructure, human resources, and technology stack; regulatory considerations; and financial considerations. This review provides an overview of best practices and knowledge gaps of this domain in health care and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the literature, which may be useful to health care machine learning practitioners and consumers.",

The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0. Finally, we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review, research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in CI-NGWNs to realize Industry 5.0.",

However, unlike general-purpose programming languages (GPLs), IaC scripts use domain-specific languages, and metrics used for GPLs may not be applicable for IaC scripts.

However, we consider major issues that prevent a widespread use of AR towards robotics in industries. Initially, the commissioning of AR devices for robotic applications demands spatial referencing of robots and AR devices. Fiducial markers are a popular artificial aid, but hard to implement in industrial use cases because of additional efforts and a lack of robustness. A further bottleneck for developing AR applications in robotics is the restricted technical and ergonomic maturity of AR devices, e.g. limited local computation and short product life-cycles. Furthermore, benefit through AR in comparison to classic online and offline programming techniques is still unclear for most applicators. In this paper, we present approaches towards a distributed, hardware-agnostic microservice architecture with standard interfaces for an interoperable usage of AR in robotics. Furthermore, we present marker-less pose estimation methods for articulated robot arms as well as mobile robots based on RGB and depth images that serve automatic referencing. Finally, we reveal further application potential of AR in robotics in terms of combining advantages from online and offline programming.",

        "abstract": "A great lack of 5G design is the traditional bottom-up development of network evolution, which has not effectively considered the requirements of applications and, particularly, vehicle to everything (V2X) applications. This paper provides a service-centric approach towards 6G V2X, with a concise overview of the upcoming hyper-connected vehicular ecosystem and its integration in the whole 6G fabric, analysing its particular infrastructure needs, as a way to reach key performance indicators (KPIs). We also present a 6G-oriented platform design able to manage the life-cycle of V2X applications across different domains by means of intelligent orchestration decisions.",

        "abstract": "The increasing adoption of natural language processing (NLP) models across industries has led to practitioners’ need for machine learning (ML) systems to handle these models efficiently, from training to serving them in production. However, training, deploying, and updating multiple models can be complex, costly, and time-consuming, mainly when using transformer-based pre-trained language models. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve efficiency and performance through joint training, rather than training separate models. Motivated by this, we present an overview of MTL approaches in NLP, followed by an in-depth discussion of our position on opportunities they introduce to a set of challenges across various ML lifecycle phases including data engineering, model development, deployment, and monitoring. Our position emphasizes the role of transformer-based MTL approaches in streamlining these lifecycle phases, and we assert that our systematic analysis demonstrates how transformer-based MTL in NLP effectively integrates into ML lifecycle phases. Furthermore, we hypothesize that developing a model that combines MTL for periodic re-training, and continual learning for continual updates and new capabilities integration could be practical, although its viability and effectiveness still demand a substantial empirical investigation.",

The control system of the TCV tokamak has recently seen a major upgrade in terms of its hardware and software components. Control algorithms are entirely programmed and tested in MATLAB/Simulink(R), executable code is automatically generated and interfaced to run-time parameters and signals through introspection using the MARTe2 software framework. The primary control system (used for coil currents, plasma current, position, shape and density control) has been upgraded by installing new analog signal inputs/output hardware, connected to two real-time computers that can operate in parallel. In addition, an EtherCAT-based real-time industrial network has been deployed to operate distributed low Input/Output count subsystems, greatly boosting the system flexibility and reach. The majority of TCV’s real-time codes have been ported to this new approach, such as the real-time equilibrium reconstruction (LIUQE), real-time Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics mode analysis algorithms, and a real-time plasma supervision, actuator management and plasma event monitor, including real-time plasma analysis using neural networks, and plasma disruption avoidance control schemes.",

Specifically, it determines what emerging technologies are most studied concerning their impacts on accountants’ role and skills, which research strategies are used in the studies that focus on this theme, and the impacts of the identified emerging technologies on accountants’ skills. It also investigates whether open innovation is an influencing factor in this connection. Methodology: Through a systematic literature review following the five-step approach described by Denyer and Tranfield, the Web of Science and Scopus databases are used as a source of article collection. Thus, our analysis starts with a total of 157 articles. Findings: The main analytical results of the study identify the skills that today’s accountants must have and what role is assigned to them. Practical implications: Professional bodies and regulators may take the results into account in informing the revision of standards, rules, and laws for the new environment. Educational institutions can use the results to adjust their programs to prepare students with the skills employers expect them to have. Contribution: This study provides an integrated understanding of the implications of recent technological developments on the accountant’s role and skills that have been hitherto discussed in the existing literature in a fragmented way. Future research suggestions are also provided, based on identified gaps in the literature, assisting other researchers in finding a way to augment knowledge in this area.",

The primary focus of DevOps is to increase the deployment speed, frequency and quality. DevOps is a mixture of different developments and operations to its multitudinous ramifications in software development industries, DevOps have attracted the interest of many researchers. There are considerable literature surveys on this critical innovation in software development, yet, little attention has been given to DevOps impact on software quality. This research is aimed at analyzing the implications of DevOps features on software quality. DevOps can also be referred to a change in organization cultures aimed at removal of gaps between the development and operations of an organization. The adoption of DevOps in an organization provides many benefits including quality but also brings challenges to an organization. This study presents systematic mapping of the impact of DevOps on software quality. The results of this study provide a better understanding of DevOps on software quality for both professionals and researchers working in this area. The study shows research was mainly focused in automation, culture, continuous delivery, fast feedback of DevOps. There is need of further research in many areas of DevOps (for instance: measurement, development of metrics of different stages to assess its performance, culture, practices toward ensuring quality assurance, and quality factors such as usability, efficiency, software maintainability and portability).",

One of the key challenges involves developing an ecosystem of information technology infrastructure for enabling scalable and reproducible bioinformatics services that is resilient and secure for handling genetic and protected health information, often embedded in an existing non–bioinformatics-oriented infrastructure. Container technology provides an ideal and infrastructure-agnostic solution for molecular laboratories developing and using bioinformatics pipelines, whether on-premise or using the cloud. A container is a technology that provides a consistent computational environment and enables reproducibility, scalability, and security when developing NGS bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Containers can increase the bioinformatics team's productivity by automating and simplifying the maintenance of complex bioinformatics resources, as well as facilitate validation, version control, and documentation necessary for clinical laboratory regulatory compliance. Although there is increasing popularity in adopting containers for developing NGS bioinformatics pipelines, there is wide variability and inconsistency in the usage of containers that may result in suboptimal performance and potentially compromise the security and privacy of protected health information. In this article, the authors highlight the current state and provide best or recommended practices for building, using containers in NGS bioinformatics solutions in a clinical setting with focus on scalability, optimization, maintainability, and data security.",

A scoping review was conducted using the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scopus databases. We used MeSH and non-MeSH search terms to identify pertinent articles, with the authors performing 2 screening phases and assigning relevance scores: 148 English language articles most salient to the review were eligible for inclusion; 98 offered the most unique information and these were supplemented by 50 additional sources, yielding 148 references. From the 148 references, we distilled 7 key topic areas, based on a synthesis of the available literature and how that aligned with practitioner needs. The 7 topic areas were machine learning model monitoring; automated retraining systems; ethics, equity, and bias; clinical workflow integration; infrastructure, human resources, and technology stack; regulatory considerations; and financial considerations. This review provides an overview of best practices and knowledge gaps of this domain in health care and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the literature, which may be useful to health care machine learning practitioners and consumers.",

        "abstract": "Industry 5.0 vision, a step toward the next industrial revolution and enhancement to Industry 4.0, conceives the new goals of resilient, sustainable, and human-centric approaches in diverse emerging applications such as factories-of-the-future and digital society. The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0. Finally, we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review, research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in CI-NGWNs to realize Industry 5.0.",

On the one hand, although IaC represents an ever-increasing widely adopted practice nowadays, still little is known concerning how to best maintain, speedily evolve, and continuously improve the code behind the IaC practice in a measurable fashion. On the other hand, source code measurements are often computed and analyzed to evaluate the different quality aspects of the software developed. However, unlike general-purpose programming languages (GPLs), IaC scripts use domain-specific languages, and metrics used for GPLs may not be applicable for IaC scripts. This article proposes a catalog consisting of 46 metrics to identify IaC properties focusing on Ansible, one of the most popular IaC language to date, and shows how they can be used to analyze IaC scripts.",

        "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential for facilitating the interaction with robots by enhancing the operator’s spatial understanding as well as providing further cognitive support, e.g. in order to make manual programming processes more efficient and provide on-site simulation. However, we consider major issues that prevent a widespread use of AR towards robotics in industries. Initially, the commissioning of AR devices for robotic applications demands spatial referencing of robots and AR devices. Fiducial markers are a popular artificial aid, but hard to implement in industrial use cases because of additional efforts and a lack of robustness. A further bottleneck for developing AR applications in robotics is the restricted technical and ergonomic maturity of AR devices, e.g. limited local computation and short product life-cycles. Furthermore, benefit through AR in comparison to classic online and offline programming techniques is still unclear for most applicators. In this paper, we present approaches towards a distributed, hardware-agnostic microservice architecture with standard interfaces for an interoperable usage of AR in robotics. Furthermore, we present marker-less pose estimation methods for articulated robot arms as well as mobile robots based on RGB and depth images that serve automatic referencing. Finally, we reveal further application potential of AR in robotics in terms of combining advantages from online and offline programming.",

Industries such as banking, insurance, and investment are experiencing a significant shift due to the growth of DeFi. The decentralized finance market is expanding exponentially, emphasizing the potential of digital currencies and decentralized platforms in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm. It eliminates the need for costly intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, and increases accessibility to financial services for everyone, regardless of their geographic location or economic status. With the enormous increase in cryptocurrency investment, individuals and institutions have started to use DeFi. In this context, understanding the architecture and working mechanisms of different DeFi protocols becomes crucial in creating new and innovative products. This review paper explores various DeFi protocols, including derivatives, decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and borrowing, asset management, and stablecoins.

However, training, deploying, and updating multiple models can be complex, costly, and time-consuming, mainly when using transformer-based pre-trained language models. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve efficiency and performance through joint training, rather than training separate models. Motivated by this, we present an overview of MTL approaches in NLP, followed by an in-depth discussion of our position on opportunities they introduce to a set of challenges across various ML lifecycle phases including data engineering, model development, deployment, and monitoring. Our position emphasizes the role of transformer-based MTL approaches in streamlining these lifecycle phases, and we assert that our systematic analysis demonstrates how transformer-based MTL in NLP effectively integrates into ML lifecycle phases. Furthermore, we hypothesize that developing a model that combines MTL for periodic re-training, and continual learning for continual updates and new capabilities integration could be practical, although its viability and effectiveness still demand a substantial empirical investigation.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: This paper reviews the recent accounting literature focusing on emerging technologies’ impacts on accountants’ role and skills. Specifically, it determines what emerging technologies are most studied concerning their impacts on accountants’ role and skills, which research strategies are used in the studies that focus on this theme, and the impacts of the identified emerging technologies on accountants’ skills. It also investigates whether open innovation is an influencing factor in this connection. Methodology: Through a systematic literature review following the five-step approach described by Denyer and Tranfield, the Web of Science and Scopus databases are used as a source of article collection. Thus, our analysis starts with a total of 157 articles. Findings: The main analytical results of the study identify the skills that today’s accountants must have and what role is assigned to them. Practical implications: Professional bodies and regulators may take the results into account in informing the revision of standards, rules, and laws for the new environment. Educational institutions can use the results to adjust their programs to prepare students with the skills employers expect them to have. Contribution: This study provides an integrated understanding of the implications of recent technological developments on the accountant’s role and skills that have been hitherto discussed in the existing literature in a fragmented way. Future research suggestions are also provided, based on identified gaps in the literature, assisting other researchers in finding a way to augment knowledge in this area.",

        "abstract": "Quality pressure is one of the factors affecting processes for software development in its various stages. DevOps is one of the proposed solutions to such pressure. The primary focus of DevOps is to increase the deployment speed, frequency and quality. DevOps is a mixture of different developments and operations to its multitudinous ramifications in software development industries, DevOps have attracted the interest of many researchers. There are considerable literature surveys on this critical innovation in software development, yet, little attention has been given to DevOps impact on software quality. This research is aimed at analyzing the implications of DevOps features on software quality. DevOps can also be referred to a change in organization cultures aimed at removal of gaps between the development and operations of an organization. The adoption of DevOps in an organization provides many benefits including quality but also brings challenges to an organization. This study presents systematic mapping of the impact of DevOps on software quality. The results of this study provide a better understanding of DevOps on software quality for both professionals and researchers working in this area. The study shows research was mainly focused in automation, culture, continuous delivery, fast feedback of DevOps. There is need of further research in many areas of DevOps (for instance: measurement, development of metrics of different stages to assess its performance, culture, practices toward ensuring quality assurance, and quality factors such as usability, efficiency, software maintainability and portability).",

        "abstract": "Systematic implementation of bioinformatics resources for next generation sequencing (NGS)-based clinical testing is an arduous undertaking. One of the key challenges involves developing an ecosystem of information technology infrastructure for enabling scalable and reproducible bioinformatics services that is resilient and secure for handling genetic and protected health information, often embedded in an existing non–bioinformatics-oriented infrastructure. Container technology provides an ideal and infrastructure-agnostic solution for molecular laboratories developing and using bioinformatics pipelines, whether on-premise or using the cloud. A container is a technology that provides a consistent computational environment and enables reproducibility, scalability, and security when developing NGS bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Containers can increase the bioinformatics team's productivity by automating and simplifying the maintenance of complex bioinformatics resources, as well as facilitate validation, version control, and documentation necessary for clinical laboratory regulatory compliance. Although there is increasing popularity in adopting containers for developing NGS bioinformatics pipelines, there is wide variability and inconsistency in the usage of containers that may result in suboptimal performance and potentially compromise the security and privacy of protected health information. In this article, the authors highlight the current state and provide best or recommended practices for building, using containers in NGS bioinformatics solutions in a clinical setting with focus on scalability, optimization, maintainability, and data security.",

A scoping review was conducted using the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scopus databases. We used MeSH and non-MeSH search terms to identify pertinent articles, with the authors performing 2 screening phases and assigning relevance scores: 148 English language articles most salient to the review were eligible for inclusion; 98 offered the most unique information and these were supplemented by 50 additional sources, yielding 148 references. From the 148 references, we distilled 7 key topic areas, based on a synthesis of the available literature and how that aligned with practitioner needs. The 7 topic areas were machine learning model monitoring; automated retraining systems; ethics, equity, and bias; clinical workflow integration; infrastructure, human resources, and technology stack; regulatory considerations; and financial considerations. This review provides an overview of best practices and knowledge gaps of this domain in health care and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the literature, which may be useful to health care machine learning practitioners and consumers.",

The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0.

On the other hand, source code measurements are often computed and analyzed to evaluate the different quality aspects of the software developed. However, unlike general-purpose programming languages (GPLs), IaC scripts use domain-specific languages, and metrics used for GPLs may not be applicable for IaC scripts.

        "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential for facilitating the interaction with robots by enhancing the operator’s spatial understanding as well as providing further cognitive support, e.g. in order to make manual programming processes more efficient and provide on-site simulation. However, we consider major issues that prevent a widespread use of AR towards robotics in industries. Initially, the commissioning of AR devices for robotic applications demands spatial referencing of robots and AR devices. Fiducial markers are a popular artificial aid, but hard to implement in industrial use cases because of additional efforts and a lack of robustness. A further bottleneck for developing AR applications in robotics is the restricted technical and ergonomic maturity of AR devices, e.g. limited local computation and short product life-cycles. Furthermore, benefit through AR in comparison to classic online and offline programming techniques is still unclear for most applicators. In this paper, we present approaches towards a distributed, hardware-agnostic microservice architecture with standard interfaces for an interoperable usage of AR in robotics. Furthermore, we present marker-less pose estimation methods for articulated robot arms as well as mobile robots based on RGB and depth images that serve automatic referencing. Finally, we reveal further application potential of AR in robotics in terms of combining advantages from online and offline programming.",

Industries such as banking, insurance, and investment are experiencing a significant shift due to the growth of DeFi. The decentralized finance market is expanding exponentially, emphasizing the potential of digital currencies and decentralized platforms in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm. It eliminates the need for costly intermediaries, reduces transaction fees, and increases accessibility to financial services for everyone, regardless of their geographic location or economic status. With the enormous increase in cryptocurrency investment, individuals and institutions have started to use DeFi. In this context, understanding the architecture and working mechanisms of different DeFi protocols becomes crucial in creating new and innovative products. This review paper explores various DeFi protocols, including derivatives, decentralized exchanges (DEX), lending and borrowing, asset management, and stablecoins. It analyses their internal structure and composability, providing insights into how these protocols can be combined to create new and innovative DeFi products and explore the potential of DeFi in providing an alternative to the traditional finance paradigm.",

        "abstract": "The increasing adoption of natural language processing (NLP) models across industries has led to practitioners’ need for machine learning (ML) systems to handle these models efficiently, from training to serving them in production. However, training, deploying, and updating multiple models can be complex, costly, and time-consuming, mainly when using transformer-based pre-trained language models. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve efficiency and performance through joint training, rather than training separate models. Motivated by this, we present an overview of MTL approaches in NLP, followed by an in-depth discussion of our position on opportunities they introduce to a set of challenges across various ML lifecycle phases including data engineering, model development, deployment, and monitoring. Our position emphasizes the role of transformer-based MTL approaches in streamlining these lifecycle phases, and we assert that our systematic analysis demonstrates how transformer-based MTL in NLP effectively integrates into ML lifecycle phases. Furthermore, we hypothesize that developing a model that combines MTL for periodic re-training, and continual learning for continual updates and new capabilities integration could be practical, although its viability and effectiveness still demand a substantial empirical investigation.",

The primary control system (used for coil currents, plasma current, position, shape and density control) has been upgraded by installing new analog signal inputs/output hardware, connected to two real-time computers that can operate in parallel. In addition, an EtherCAT-based real-time industrial network has been deployed to operate distributed low Input/Output count subsystems, greatly boosting the system flexibility and reach. The majority of TCV’s real-time codes have been ported to this new approach, such as the real-time equilibrium reconstruction (LIUQE), real-time Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics mode analysis algorithms, and a real-time plasma supervision, actuator management and plasma event monitor, including real-time plasma analysis using neural networks, and plasma disruption avoidance control schemes.",

Specifically, it determines what emerging technologies are most studied concerning their impacts on accountants’ role and skills, which research strategies are used in the studies that focus on this theme, and the impacts of the identified emerging technologies on accountants’ skills. It also investigates whether open innovation is an influencing factor in this connection. Methodology: Through a systematic literature review following the five-step approach described by Denyer and Tranfield, the Web of Science and Scopus databases are used as a source of article collection. Thus, our analysis starts with a total of 157 articles. Findings: The main analytical results of the study identify the skills that today’s accountants must have and what role is assigned to them. Practical implications: Professional bodies and regulators may take the results into account in informing the revision of standards, rules, and laws for the new environment. Educational institutions can use the results to adjust their programs to prepare students with the skills employers expect them to have. Contribution: This study provides an integrated understanding of the implications of recent technological developments on the accountant’s role and skills that have been hitherto discussed in the existing literature in a fragmented way. Future research suggestions are also provided, based on identified gaps in the literature, assisting other researchers in finding a way to augment knowledge in this area.",

The primary focus of DevOps is to increase the deployment speed, frequency and quality. DevOps is a mixture of different developments and operations to its multitudinous ramifications in software development industries, DevOps have attracted the interest of many researchers. There are considerable literature surveys on this critical innovation in software development, yet, little attention has been given to DevOps impact on software quality. This research is aimed at analyzing the implications of DevOps features on software quality. DevOps can also be referred to a change in organization cultures aimed at removal of gaps between the development and operations of an organization. The adoption of DevOps in an organization provides many benefits including quality but also brings challenges to an organization. This study presents systematic mapping of the impact of DevOps on software quality. The results of this study provide a better understanding of DevOps on software quality for both professionals and researchers working in this area. The study shows research was mainly focused in automation, culture, continuous delivery, fast feedback of DevOps. There is need of further research in many areas of DevOps (for instance: measurement, development of metrics of different stages to assess its performance, culture, practices toward ensuring quality assurance, and quality factors such as usability, efficiency, software maintainability and portability).",

Although pioneering research has shown the potential of using ML techniques to improve RE practices, there lacks a systematic and comprehensive literature review in academia that integrates an industrial perspective. Specifically, none of the reviews available in ML4RE have considered the grey literature, which is primarily from practitioner origin and is more reflective of the real issues and challenges faced in practice.",

        "abstract": "Systematic implementation of bioinformatics resources for next generation sequencing (NGS)-based clinical testing is an arduous undertaking. One of the key challenges involves developing an ecosystem of information technology infrastructure for enabling scalable and reproducible bioinformatics services that is resilient and secure for handling genetic and protected health information, often embedded in an existing non–bioinformatics-oriented infrastructure. Container technology provides an ideal and infrastructure-agnostic solution for molecular laboratories developing and using bioinformatics pipelines, whether on-premise or using the cloud. A container is a technology that provides a consistent computational environment and enables reproducibility, scalability, and security when developing NGS bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Containers can increase the bioinformatics team's productivity by automating and simplifying the maintenance of complex bioinformatics resources, as well as facilitate validation, version control, and documentation necessary for clinical laboratory regulatory compliance. Although there is increasing popularity in adopting containers for developing NGS bioinformatics pipelines, there is wide variability and inconsistency in the usage of containers that may result in suboptimal performance and potentially compromise the security and privacy of protected health information. In this article, the authors highlight the current state and provide best or recommended practices for building, using containers in NGS bioinformatics solutions in a clinical setting with focus on scalability, optimization, maintainability, and data security.",

However, the processes that support these tools in deployment, that is, machine learning operations, are still emerging. The purpose of this work was not only to provide a comprehensive synthesis of existing literature in the field but also to identify gaps and offer insights for adoption in clinical practice. A scoping review was conducted using the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, and Scopus databases. We used MeSH and non-MeSH search terms to identify pertinent articles, with the authors performing 2 screening phases and assigning relevance scores: 148 English language articles most salient to the review were eligible for inclusion; 98 offered the most unique information and these were supplemented by 50 additional sources, yielding 148 references. From the 148 references, we distilled 7 key topic areas, based on a synthesis of the available literature and how that aligned with practitioner needs. The 7 topic areas were machine learning model monitoring; automated retraining systems; ethics, equity, and bias; clinical workflow integration; infrastructure, human resources, and technology stack; regulatory considerations; and financial considerations. This review provides an overview of best practices and knowledge gaps of this domain in health care and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the literature, which may be useful to health care machine learning practitioners and consumers.",

The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey. In this article, we address this issue by reviewing and analyzing current emerging concepts and technologies, e.g., CI tools and frameworks, network-in-box architecture, open radio access networks, softwarized service architectures, potential enabling services, and others, elemental and holistic for designing the objectives of CI-NGWNs to fulfill the Industry 5.0 vision requirements. Furthermore, we outline and discuss ongoing initiatives, demos, and frameworks linked to Industry 5.0. Finally, we provide a list of lessons learned from our detailed review, research challenges, and open issues that should be addressed in CI-NGWNs to realize Industry 5.0.",

On the other hand, source code measurements are often computed and analyzed to evaluate the different quality aspects of the software developed. However, unlike general-purpose programming languages (GPLs), IaC scripts use domain-specific languages, and metrics used for GPLs may not be applicable for IaC scripts. This article proposes a catalog consisting of 46 metrics to identify IaC properties focusing on Ansible, one of the most popular IaC language to date, and shows how they can be used to analyze IaC scripts.",

However, we consider major issues that prevent a widespread use of AR towards robotics in industries. Initially, the commissioning of AR devices for robotic applications demands spatial referencing of robots and AR devices. Fiducial markers are a popular artificial aid, but hard to implement in industrial use cases because of additional efforts and a lack of robustness. A further bottleneck for developing AR applications in robotics is the restricted technical and ergonomic maturity of AR devices, e.g. limited local computation and short product life-cycles. Furthermore, benefit through AR in comparison to classic online and offline programming techniques is still unclear for most applicators. In this paper, we present approaches towards a distributed, hardware-agnostic microservice architecture with standard interfaces for an interoperable usage of AR in robotics. Furthermore, we present marker-less pose estimation methods for articulated robot arms as well as mobile robots based on RGB and depth images that serve automatic referencing. Finally, we reveal further application potential of AR in robotics in terms of combining advantages from online and offline programming.",

        "abstract": "The increasing adoption of natural language processing (NLP) models across industries has led to practitioners’ need for machine learning (ML) systems to handle these models efficiently, from training to serving them in production. However, training, deploying, and updating multiple models can be complex, costly, and time-consuming, mainly when using transformer-based pre-trained language models. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve efficiency and performance through joint training, rather than training separate models. Motivated by this, we present an overview of MTL approaches in NLP, followed by an in-depth discussion of our position on opportunities they introduce to a set of challenges across various ML lifecycle phases including data engineering, model development, deployment, and monitoring. Our position emphasizes the role of transformer-based MTL approaches in streamlining these lifecycle phases, and we assert that our systematic analysis demonstrates how transformer-based MTL in NLP effectively integrates into ML lifecycle phases. Furthermore, we hypothesize that developing a model that combines MTL for periodic re-training, and continual learning for continual updates and new capabilities integration could be practical, although its viability and effectiveness still demand a substantial empirical investigation.",

The control system of the TCV tokamak has recently seen a major upgrade in terms of its hardware and software components. Control algorithms are entirely programmed and tested in MATLAB/Simulink(R), executable code is automatically generated and interfaced to run-time parameters and signals through introspection using the MARTe2 software framework. The primary control system (used for coil currents, plasma current, position, shape and density control) has been upgraded by installing new analog signal inputs/output hardware, connected to two real-time computers that can operate in parallel. In addition, an EtherCAT-based real-time industrial network has been deployed to operate distributed low Input/Output count subsystems, greatly boosting the system flexibility and reach. The majority of TCV’s real-time codes have been ported to this new approach, such as the real-time equilibrium reconstruction (LIUQE), real-time Magneto-Hydro-Dynamics mode analysis algorithms, and a real-time plasma supervision, actuator management and plasma event monitor, including real-time plasma analysis using neural networks, and plasma disruption avoidance control schemes.",

Specifically, it determines what emerging technologies are most studied concerning their impacts on accountants’ role and skills, which research strategies are used in the studies that focus on this theme, and the impacts of the identified emerging technologies on accountants’ skills. It also investigates whether open innovation is an influencing factor in this connection. Methodology: Through a systematic literature review following the five-step approach described by Denyer and Tranfield, the Web of Science and Scopus databases are used as a source of article collection. Thus, our analysis starts with a total of 157 articles. Findings: The main analytical results of the study identify the skills that today’s accountants must have and what role is assigned to them. Practical implications: Professional bodies and regulators may take the results into account in informing the revision of standards, rules, and laws for the new environment. Educational institutions can use the results to adjust their programs to prepare students with the skills employers expect them to have. Contribution: This study provides an integrated understanding of the implications of recent technological developments on the accountant’s role and skills that have been hitherto discussed in the existing literature in a fragmented way. Future research suggestions are also provided, based on identified gaps in the literature, assisting other researchers in finding a way to augment knowledge in this area.",

        "abstract": "Quality pressure is one of the factors affecting processes for software development in its various stages. DevOps is one of the proposed solutions to such pressure. The primary focus of DevOps is to increase the deployment speed, frequency and quality. DevOps is a mixture of different developments and operations to its multitudinous ramifications in software development industries, DevOps have attracted the interest of many researchers. There are considerable literature surveys on this critical innovation in software development, yet, little attention has been given to DevOps impact on software quality. This research is aimed at analyzing the implications of DevOps features on software quality. DevOps can also be referred to a change in organization cultures aimed at removal of gaps between the development and operations of an organization. The adoption of DevOps in an organization provides many benefits including quality but also brings challenges to an organization. This study presents systematic mapping of the impact of DevOps on software quality. The results of this study provide a better understanding of DevOps on software quality for both professionals and researchers working in this area. The study shows research was mainly focused in automation, culture, continuous delivery, fast feedback of DevOps. There is need of further research in many areas of DevOps (for instance: measurement, development of metrics of different stages to assess its performance, culture, practices toward ensuring quality assurance, and quality factors such as usability, efficiency, software maintainability and portability).",

One of the key challenges involves developing an ecosystem of information technology infrastructure for enabling scalable and reproducible bioinformatics services that is resilient and secure for handling genetic and protected health information, often embedded in an existing non–bioinformatics-oriented infrastructure. Container technology provides an ideal and infrastructure-agnostic solution for molecular laboratories developing and using bioinformatics pipelines, whether on-premise or using the cloud. A container is a technology that provides a consistent computational environment and enables reproducibility, scalability, and security when developing NGS bioinformatics analysis pipelines. Containers can increase the bioinformatics team's productivity by automating and simplifying the maintenance of complex bioinformatics resources, as well as facilitate validation, version control, and documentation necessary for clinical laboratory regulatory compliance. Although there is increasing popularity in adopting containers for developing NGS bioinformatics pipelines, there is wide variability and inconsistency in the usage of containers that may result in suboptimal performance and potentially compromise the security and privacy of protected health information. In this article, the authors highlight the current state and provide best or recommended practices for building, using containers in NGS bioinformatics solutions in a clinical setting with focus on scalability, optimization, maintainability, and data security.",

The vision seeks to leverage human intelligence and creativity in nexus with intelligent, efficient, and reliable cognitive collaborating robots (cobots) to achieve zero waste, zero-defect, and mass customization-based manufacturing solutions. However, it requires merging distinctive cyber–physical worlds through intelligent orchestration of various technological enablers, e.g., cognitive cobots, human-centric artificial intelligence (AI), cyber–physical systems, digital twins, hyperconverged data storage and computing, communication infrastructure, and others. In this regard, the convergence of the emerging computational intelligence (CI) paradigm and softwarized next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs) can fulfill the stringent communication and computation requirements of the technological enablers of the Industry 5.0, which is the aim of this survey.

        "abstract": "Edge computing has emerged as a promising computing paradigm that enables real-time data processing and analysis closer to the data source and boosts decision-making applications in a safe manner. On the other hand, the microservice is a new type of architecture that can be dynamically deployed, migrating across edge clouds on demand. Therefore, the combination of these two technologies can provide numerous benefits, including improved performance, reduced latency, and better resource utilization. In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of state-of-the-art research on the use of microservices in edge computing environments. We take into consideration several distinct microservice research directions, including coordination, orchestration, repositories, scheduling, autoscaling, deployment, resource management, and different security issues. Furthermore, we explore the potential applications of microservices in edge computing across various domains. Finally, the unsolved research issues and future directions of emerging trends in this area are also discussed.",

        "abstract": "Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) is a practice to implement continuous deployment by allowing management and provisioning of infrastructure through the definition of machine-readable files and automation around them, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. On the one hand, although IaC represents an ever-increasing widely adopted practice nowadays, still little is known concerning how to best maintain, speedily evolve, and continuously improve the code behind the IaC practice in a measurable fashion. On the other hand, source code measurements are often computed and analyzed to evaluate the different quality aspects of the software developed. However, unlike general-purpose programming languages (GPLs), IaC scripts use domain-specific languages, and metrics used for GPLs may not be applicable for IaC scripts. This article proposes a catalog consisting of 46 metrics to identify IaC properties focusing on Ansible, one of the most popular IaC language to date, and shows how they can be used to analyze IaC scripts.",

        "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) has the potential for facilitating the interaction with robots by enhancing the operator’s spatial understanding as well as providing further cognitive support, e.g. in order to make manual programming processes more efficient and provide on-site simulation. However, we consider major issues that prevent a widespread use of AR towards robotics in industries. Initially, the commissioning of AR devices for robotic applications demands spatial referencing of robots and AR devices. Fiducial markers are a popular artificial aid, but hard to implement in industrial use cases because of additional efforts and a lack of robustness. A further bottleneck for developing AR applications in robotics is the restricted technical and ergonomic maturity of AR devices, e.g. limited local computation and short product life-cycles. Furthermore, benefit through AR in comparison to classic online and offline programming techniques is still unclear for most applicators. In this paper, we present approaches towards a distributed, hardware-agnostic microservice architecture with standard interfaces for an interoperable usage of AR in robotics. Furthermore, we present marker-less pose estimation methods for articulated robot arms as well as mobile robots based on RGB and depth images that serve automatic referencing. Finally, we reveal further application potential of AR in robotics in terms of combining advantages from online and offline programming.",
