        "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669013/",
        "Abstract": "Recent advancements in Generative AI (GenAI) algorithms have been reshaping the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) landscape. These transformations not only enhance the speed, accuracy, and productivity of SDLC tasks but also influence the roles and existence of software personas within the SDLC ecosystem. This study evaluates GenAI's effects on the roles of software personas engaged in the typical SDLC phases: planning, design, development, testing, and deployment. When evaluating these effects, it becomes evident that GenAI's impact varies across roles and their relation to specific SDLC phases and activities. While some roles experience a substantial impact, achieving full AI-driven automation remains a challenge for roles that demand critical thinking, empathy, and other human supervision. Overall, GenAI's penetration will necessitate new skills and a redefinition of roles for many tasks within SDLC, where humans and AI will collaborate to create better, faster, and more efficient software.",

        "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10735195/",
        "Abstract": "The widespread adoption of Cloud-Based Web Microservices (CBWMs) and DevSecOps (Development, Security, and Operations) methodologies has significantly improved modern software development, particularly regarding scalability, agility, and security. However, the true success of these implementations hinges on the ability to measure their effectiveness accurately. Metrics serve as a critical tool in this process, providing quantifiable data on service performance, security, and operational efficiency. By leveraging these metrics, organizations can better assess the efficiency of their DevSecOps practices, making them invaluable for informed decision-making, trend analysis, process management, and continuous improvement. This paper introduces 12 key quantitative metrics specifically designed to evaluate the quality of CBWMs developed through DevSecOps practices. These metrics were identified using a Multi-Vocal Literature Reviewmethodology, sourcing information from 92 relevant studies (2018-2023) on IEEE Xplore, Springer, and Google Scholar. The selected metrics are widely applicable across CBWMs and are easy to measure with existing tools, offering a comprehensive framework for thorough assessment.",

        "Link": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643552/",
        "Abstract": "Recently, 6G has attracted widespread attention from both academia and industry. 6G networks are expected to exhibit even more heterogeneity than 5G networks, and support various emerging scenarios and applications such as virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), air/space/ground networks, and Internet of Things. Such massive heterogeneous devices pose huge challenges for network control and management. Recently, advances in artificial intelligence have brought to a new clan of networks, termed as self-driving 6G networks. It utilizes network telemetry, artificial intelligence, and DevOps to simplify networks and operations, helping network owners improve network quality, as well as increase efficiency. However, the current network is built on closed merchant switching ASICs and a homegrown management and control system. Self-driving an opaque system without really knowing and controlling what they do is a hazardous and fruitless endeavor. Fortunately, the network programmability technology opens the possibility for running self-driving algorithms over the whole network. In this paper, we design a full-dimensional programmability empowered self-driving 6G network architecture. We discuss how network programmability can promote the release of network intelligence, from the view of both verticality (control and data plane) and horizontality (end to end). Moreover, three use cases are designed to demonstrate that the proposed architecture can automatically cope with the dynamically changing complex network environment, realize automatic perception and automatic decision, and then facilitate the automation level of the network and enhance the performance of the network.",
